And with that recently, they have a residence two Thursdays a month in the well-known Moog.\n\nAlthough he likes to play all kinds of styles within electronic music and he prefers not to be pigeonholed in any of them, if he had to define himself, he would describe himself as a disc jockey who tries to be as hypnotic as possible.\n\nWith the philosophy of learning from all the music players but always measuring himself with his idols, his concept of success is to perceive that people who dance feel the same as he does while he is behind the plates.",

You have arrived in Utrecht. Call it Little Cornwall if you will, because it was in the South-West corner of England that lads like Aphex Twin, Luke Vibert and Mike Paradinas made their quirky yet emotional electronic music without acting cool as was common practice in the dancemusic scene at the time.\nIt's exactly this Cornish way of life that appealed to the boys of Utrecht's dj-collective and recordlabel 030303. Mind you, 030303 are not ashamed of their love for serious IDM and glitch flavoured tunes by contemporary hotshots such as Richard Devine and Nosaj Thing. But they also enjoy watching the unsure expressions on the faces of their fellow music lovers whilst playing eurotrashy tunes by the likes of Twenty 4 Seven and Quadrophonia in trashy taverns such as Tivoli, Ekko, Melkweg and Kikker.\n\nAs healthier ways of living came into fashion in the 1980s, acid became more than a mere chemical substance and started to come out of machines as well. Despite their very young age, the 030303 crew became a huge fan of a particular bassline machine made by the Roland corporation and so did other now big names such as Cylob, D'Arcangelo and Ceephax amongst others, all of which come and celebrate the acid bleep at 030303 events around Utrecht and the dandy town of Amsterdam.\n\nBeing right in the middle of the happening acid-scene, the 030303 crew could not help doing what any other freak would do: they had to start releasing acid-tunes by Braindance veterans as well as by younger musicians. 030303's chart-toppers range from subtle to bombastic and highly psychedelic, the common denominator always being a very deep bleep.\n\nIt's just as fantastic as you've just read: 030303 brings a very complete picture that will never be equaled by any other crew.

As a child, he began to experiment with the families large collection of music toys including, vinyls, drum machines, samplers, delays and microphones. At the age of 10 Juan started his collection of music: Deep techno, deep house, dub, hip hop, punk and Jazz. His collection was influenced by the detroit/chicago scene and led him to djing at underground clubs in Buenos Aires at the age of 15. Two years later, things took even more shape into Juan's curious mind as he started producing, using software and adding hardware synthesizers. \n08DOKTOR began performing all around Agentina, Colombia, and Cancun. The next decision was moving to Europe. First, Ibiza, and now living in Barcelona, Spain. Performing in Ibiza and Barcelona only took a leap for him when he became an artist under Digital Delight .

With over fifteen releases under their belt now, the label has also featured original tracks and remixes by STL, Anton Zap, Deadbeat, October, Black Light Smoke, Joey Anderson, and Tobias Freund among many others. \n\nIn 2013, Sean moved to Berlin to be closer to the thriving music scene there. He released his debut solo EP \"Kobayashi Maru\" on Voodoo Down the following year which quickly gained support from DJs like Pearson Sound and Nick H\u00f6ppner. His sophomore solo EP \u201cThe Primitive Streak\u201d arrived on Voodoo Down in October 2018. In Berlin he plays regularly at staple clubs Tresor, Salon zur Wilden Renate and Chalet, and hosts a regular label night at Farbfernseher.\n12 x 12 - Kobayashi Maru [Voodoo Down]\n12 x 12 vs. N'conduit - Sine Yo Pitty On The Runny Kine Volume 1 [RockAndRoll Records]\n12 x 12 - The Primitive Streak [Voodoo Down]\nVarious Artists - Possible Side Effects, Vol. 1 [Voodoo Down]\nVarious Artists - Possible Side Effects, Vol. 1.5 [Voodoo Down]\nVarious Artists - Possible Side Effects, Vol. 2 [Voodoo Down]\nVarious Artists - Possible Side Effects, Vol. 3 [Voodoo Down]\nOctober vs. Voodoo Down - Las Modelos [Voodoo Down]",

    "/dj/16b": "Omid16B biography\n\n\u201cI love music. How it can make our emotions flow; how it can change the way we think; the way we love; the way we express ourselves.\u201d (Omid 16B)\n\n\u201cSome DJs and producers have their finger on the pulse \u2013 Omid 16B is the pulse. Music runs through his veins\u201d (DJ Mag)\n\n\nOmid Nourizadeh also known as Omid 16B, is a DJ whose passion for cutting edge electronic music is unrivalled. As a DJ and producer, songwriter, musician and label boss, Omid has forged a unique and prolific career as one of the world\u2019s most talented and respected musicians and producers.\n\nHe\u2019s much regarded as one of the leaders who pioneered the tech house movement back in the early nineties, alongside the likes of Carl Craig, Vince Watson, Craig Richards, Mr C, Steve Bug and Francois K .\nGrowing up in London, with Persian roots, Omid was influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Cure, Depeche Mode, RIDE and The Mission. Throughout his teens he became an accomplished musician playing a list of instruments while attending Richmond College and utilising the music rooms at any given chance.\n\u201cI was supposed to be studying but always missed a lesson or two if the music rooms were free\u201d\nOmid played his first gig in his home town Putney at the age of sixteen (Vocals/ Guitar), performing with his own band \u201cThe Reunion\u201d which continued to play the pub circuit in London for a further two years.\nIn the Early nineties the \u2018Acid House Movement\u2019 was turning heads, as was Omid\u2019s enthusiasm to learn more about production and the independence to express one\u2019s self without compromise. Gradually Omid\u2019s tastes became increasingly more electronic based rather than indie rock. In 1994, he made the pivotal step of setting up his deep-house label Alola Records, followed by his tech-house driven Disclosure imprint in 1995 and later down the road, SexOnWax Recordings in 2002.\n\nWith an impressive discography of singles, LPs and compilation albums released on his own imprints, as well as signed to the likes of Eye Q, Hooj Choons, Stomp/EQ, Yoshitoshi, Ministry Of Sound, Tsuba and Bedrock, Omid has maintained the highest quality throughout his prolific career\u2026 without any commercial compromise.\nKnown to produce under a number of pseudonyms including Phaser, 16B, Pre 4, OTC, Changing Shape, Sixteen Souls, \u00a310.42 Million Dollar Man and Omid 16B, Omid started a new wave of influential releases as 16B which saw his early breakthroughs; the underground hit \u2018Trail of Dreams\u2019 on StrongHouse, the critically acclaimed \u2018Secrets\u2019 on Alola and his debut album \u2018Sounds From Another Room\u2019 signed by Ben Bodie to Sven Vath\u2019s EyeQ records and released in 1998. The huge impact of \u2018Water Ride\u2019 saw 16B reaching to a wider audience, which was performed live on television for Channel 4 in the UK and was included on this debut album, with further singles \u201cBlack Hole\u201d and \u201cFalling\u201d bringing in remixes from the likes of legends like Andrew Weatherall, Stacey Pullen and Deep Dish (Dubfire & Sharam).\n\nIt was also around the same period when Omid\u2019s more diverse ORN moniker released \u2018Snow\u2019 first on Alola and now to be re-released on SexOnWax. It was quickly snapped up by James Barton head of A&R at BMG Deconstruction whilst it was still selling on Alola. With a new mix of \u201cSnow\u201d added by Omid himself, Deconstruction turned it into a national hit and marked Omid\u2019s first major label breakthrough around 1999. Further LPs followed for Glasgow\u2019s \u201cUnder The Counter\u201d label as \u00a310.42 Million Dollar Man in 2000 with Killer Tech House Bombs like \u201cSeriusex\u201d and \u201cPink Yo Black\u201d released as singles, with the second 16B album shortly after titled \u2018How To Live 100 Years\u2019 with UK leaders Hooj Choons in 2002. It was tracks like \u201cInBetween Your Choice\u201d which also put focus on this album and created another impact on the scene. With the collection of singles released from \u201cHow To Live 100 Years\u201d, Omid also included the underground fave \u201cThe Game\u201d (originally on Disclosure 1997) with a new set of remixes, another single being the garage style groover \u201cDoubt\u201d was also taken from the album. Omid achieved further success with his \u201cEscape\u201d track where Richard Morel\u2019s collaboration on the vocals led to the hit single \u2018Escape (Driving to Heaven)\u2019, which to this day is regarded as one of the most unique and influential tracks of our time.\nIn this time Omid remixed Morel\u2019s \u201cTrue\u201d which resurrected the acid house vibe yet again, getting massive support from the likes of sasha and DeepDish whilst his remixes of Creamer and K\u2019s \u201cwish you were here\u201d and Steve Lawler\u2019s \u201cRise In\u201d recognised Omid\u2019s own unique style as one of the most busiest and influential producers on the planet. More Remixes on \u201cHooj\u201d included \u201cFuture\u201d by \u201cHalo Varga\u201d and \u201cMysterious People\u2019s\u201d \u201cFly away\u201d on Yoshitoshi whilst playing a major role in starting the label Airtight with Hooj boss Red Jerry. To kick start the label, a set of 16B remixes of Francois K\u2019s \u201cTout Est Bleu\u201d licensed from Wave, then Marshal Jeffersons \u201cMushrooms\u201d and finally one single and two sublime E.P\u2019s by Omid himself under the alias \u201cChanging Shape\u201d.(which are to be re released on Alola in 2013).\n\nFrom a remix perspective, Omid has put his touch to artists such as Lana Del Rey (to be released on Alola), Morel, Natasha Atlas, The Cure, Gus Gus, UNA, Creamer & K, Danny Howells, Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian, Steve Lawler through to Pete Moss, Groove Armada (previously called Rumpus), Telex and DeepDish. Whether it was remixing Depeche Mode\u2019s \u2018Enjoy the Silence\u2019 or Prince\u2019s \u2018Kiss\u2019, Omid\u2019s bootleg-style assaults have also made him one of the first producers in the field of mashups.\n\nOmid has also earned a reputation as an industry innovator and has always been at the forefront of experimental release strategies for his material. In collaboration with DJ Magazine, he was instrumental in launching \u2018Face Off\u2019 in 2006, one of the first and most successful cover mount CD series and shortly after, a cover mount CD with DJ Mag that featured part of one of his \u2018Like 3 Ears & 1 Eye\u2019 LP in 2007. At the time, this experiment shocked the dance community, but by reaching over 35,000 fans across the UK, it also acted as a unique promotional tool for the album, which was subsequently released digitally on Sexonwax with part two in 2008.\n\nAdding to Omid\u2019s stellar production resume in 2010 was the acclaimed \u2018Sequential EP\u2019 series, starting with the hedonistic \u2018To Run To\u2019, the love song \u2018Same As You\u2019 and the \u2018The Epic\u2019 on his SexOnWax label.\nOmid\u2019s most recent compilation project, \u2018Sounds Like Alola \u2013 Vol.1: Mixed By Omid 16B\u2019, showcases what the future holds mixed seamlessly, while providing insight to the label\u2019s history, Volume 2 was mixed beautifully by Demi featuring artist on the label NAV,Charles Webster, Vince Watson, DJ Q, MR C, Trevor Loveys, Anthony Teasdale, Kevin Beber and Kevin Mckay. The future instalments of the \u2018Sounds Like Alola\u2019 series will include mixes by Mr C, Amin Edge and Omid 16B due for release in 2013.\n\nAs a DJ, Omid maintains an international schedule and tours extensively throughout Europe, the U.S. and Asia. He lays down intelligent and enchanting sets that blend together everything from sublime deep house through to dark, yet soulful, emotive techno. He takes pride in developing the party spirit when the time is right. Omid aims to develop a real connection with the audience throughout his sets. It\u2019s this connection that inspires the performance and brings out the best reaction from the dance floor.\n\n2011 and 2012 have been crazy years for Omid. Following the release of another EP on Alola, the \u201cAt Night\u201d EP and the double-A-side \u2018Rain / Passion of Zorro\u2019, as well as the follow up \u2018The Night / Electronics\u2019 on John Digweed\u2019s Bedrock imprint, Omid maintained a furious touring schedule. From Carl Craig\u2019s Planet E stage at Snowbombing, to the MTV festival in Croatia, the SW4 main stage in London, DJmag\u2019s 20th anniversary show at Space Ibiza, Bestival and the Space Closing party, Omid has moved marquee dance floors worldwide.\nIn addition to his solo work as a DJ and producer, Omid has also taken the leading role in developing a successful and creative partnership with Demi and Desyn Masiello, better known as SOS. Over the past few years, Omid has toured the planet with SexOnSubstance, using their unique inimitable DJ shows to promote their critically acclaimed compilations for Stomp/EQ (\u2018The SOS Collective \u2013 Balance 013\u2019) and Ministry Of Sound (\u2018MOS pres. SOS\u2019). Whilst being the only act to have done a three Hour Radio One Essential mix instead of the usual two hours, SOS held a long-standing residency as a trio at Ministry Of Sound (London) and are widely recognised as one of the most technically gifted and forward-thinking DJ collectives in the world.\nWhile SOS continues to perform at select shows, Omid is once again focusing on his solo work, labels and label artists.\n\nHis deep and sublime \u2018Melodica\u2019, released on Alola this past summer 2012, was instantly added to Omid\u2019s finest moments. \u2018Slap\u2019 on Sexonwax, which saw Omid bring on friends like Da Billa, Demi, Paolo Mojo and SLP on remix duties, has created much anticipation for what\u2019s to come.\nWhilst Omid has been busy with a new label management deal to set things up for 2013 he has had time for some remixes for new labels like SideWays and GrooveGarden recordings whilst taking on a few more remixes for the likes of Dave Seaman and also Chris gavin all due out on his own aLOLa label later on in 2013.\nA new 16B artist album is set for release which has seen Omid spend 6 years in the making and mastering, with singles like the widely anticipated \u201cDouble You\u201d and \"ON & OFF / On the Outside\" only heard at Omid\u2019s more recent gigs, being released in June / July 2013 hitting the Beatport top 100.\nTo celebrate 20 years in the music business, Omid and his Alola label are creating a series of very special events featuring the highest quality DJs, alongside some exceptional label releases, to mark this landmark anniversary in style.\n\nThe aLOLa Events musical odyssey has (so far) included a series of special parties with killer line-ups, where Omid 16B has been joined on the decks by his hand-picked cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the best quality DJs around: the mighty Mr C, the inimitable Danny Howells and Portugal\u2019s legendary DJ Vibe through to G House leader Amine Edge and Mexico's finest Betoko for exceptional all-night sessions. But that\u2019s not all \u2013 each party has seen additional special guests of the highest calibre, such as: Kevin MacKay, Rob Mello, Demi, Rik Parkinson, Silky, Doran, Alex george and Peeping Tom \u2013 all long-standing friends \u2013 playing superb DJ sets through the night and helping to create an amazing vibe from start to finish.\nOmid is NOW putting the finishing touches to another \u2018Sounds Like Alola\u2019 mix comp to be released in the winter of 2013 with some exclusive material by him self and artists from the camp followed by his new 16B artist album due for release in Early 2014.\n\nWith his undeniable ability and impeccable pedigree, considered alongside his impressive discography and esteemed reputation and Charisma, Omid 16B is a formidable talent and a true pioneer on the international dance circuit.\n\nstay tuned for more updates\u2026\n\n\n\nBecome a fan of Omid on FaceBook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Omid-16B/48513951494?ref=ts\nJoin Omid on MySpace: http://www.myspace.com/omid16b\nListen to Omid on Soundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/sexonwax\nOmid on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/user/shellyatsexonwax\nOfficial website (under construction) http://www.omid16b.com\nSOS The Collective official website: http://www.sosthecollective.com\n\n\nYoutube:\nOmid 16B \u2013 Rain : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5twD9V3P60\nOmid 16B - Paralexia: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA-jD76kFE\nOmid 16B feat Sophie Barker: Bites Without Teeth: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j31mKKbJxPY\nOmid 16B - The Epic: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT4uCPKp71w\nOmid 16B - Escape (Driving To Heaven): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dewKYx3zcqY\nDiscography\n\n\n\n\nALBUMS\nOmid 16B \u2013 Like 3 Ears and 1 Eye (part 2) \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2008\nOmid 16B \u2013 Like 3 Ears and 1 Eye (part 1) - SexOnWax \u2013 2007 \n16B \u2013 How to Live 100 Years \u2013 Hooj Choons \u2013 2002\n$16 Million Dollar Man \u2013 The Witch/Wich Equation \u2013 Under The Counter \u2013 2001\n16B - Sounds From Another Room \u2013 SexOnWax (EyeQ) - 1998\n\n\nMIX ALBUMS\nOmid 16B \u2013 Sounds Like Alola (part 1) \u2013 Alola Records - 2011\nSOS The Collective \u2013 MOS presents SOS \u2013 Ministry of Sound Club UK - 2010\nSOS The Collective \u2013 Balance 013 \u2013 Balance/EQ - 2008\nOmid16B/ Mr.C \u2013 Face Off \u2013 DJ magazine CD covermount \u2013 2006\nOmid16B \u2013 SexOnWax Traxx \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\nOmid16B/ Alex Neri \u2013 In House We Trust 4 \u2013 Yoshitoshi \u2013 2004\nOmid16B \u2013 Everything All of them Every Year \u2013 Alola \u2013 2002\n\n\nSINGLES\nOmid 16B \u2013 Re Arranged \u2013 Discoteca Music\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Leads To Love \u2013 tbc\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Changing Your Mind - tbc\nOmid 16B \u2013 The At Night EP \u2013 Alola Records\u2013 2011\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Cactus \u2013 Alola Records \u2013 2011\nOmid 16B \u2013 Rain/ Passion of Zorro \u2013 Bedrock \u2013 2011\nOmid 16B \u2013 Paralexia/ Bites Without Teeth \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2010\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Patient Release \u2013 Sexonwax - 2010\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Best Things In A Very Short Time \u2013 Sexonwax - 2010\nSexonsubstance (SOS) \u2013 Can\u2019t Deny The Three \u2013 Sexonwax \u2013 2010\nDabilla & Omid 16B \u2013 After All These Years \u2013 Sexonwax \u2013 2010\nOmid 16B \u2013 We Always Meet Again \u2013 Sexonwax \u2013 2010\nOmid 16B \u2013 Same As You (Saxaphone Reprise Dub) \u2013 Sexonwax - 2010\nOmid 16B \u2013 Lilly and Poppy \u2013 SexOnWax - 2010\nOmid 16B \u2013 Sequential 003 \u2013 The Epic/ Vocal/ Instrumental \u2013 SexOnWax 2009\nOmid 16B - Sequential 002 \u2013 Same As You/ The Move \u2013 SexOnWax 2009\nOmid 16B \u2013 Sequential 001 \u2013 To Run To/ The Tone \u2013 SexOnWax 2008\nOmid 16B \u2013 Changing Change EP \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2007\nRoWmiD \u2013 (Omid16B and Rowan Blades) \u2013 Teardrops/ the Rave \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2007\nOmid 16B - PSCO / U R ME \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2006\nOmid 16B - Rock-et (promo) \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2005\nMr.C & Omid 16B \u2013 That Look \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2005\nOmid 16B (Phaser) - Cold (b-side Technomonster) \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2005\nThe Idiots \u2013 TechnoMonster \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\nORN - Small Town Boy \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\nORN \u2013 The Decision \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\n16B \u2013 Inbetween Your Choice (2003 mix) \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\nThe Idiots \u2013 Dogman \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2004\nThe Idiots \u2013 Feel the Rush \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2003\n16B \u2013 Doubt (the unreleased dubs) \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2003\n16B \u2013 Doubt \u2013 Alola \u2013 2003\n16B \u2013 Doubt \u2013 Hooj Choons \u2013 2003\n$16 Million Dollar Man \u2013 Beez \u2013 SexOnWax \u2013 2002\nPhaser \u2013 Talk With Your Mouth Shut \u2013 Disclosure \u2013 2002\n16B \u2013 The Game \u2013 Hooj Choons \u2013 2001\n16B feat.

After his background in classical piano he dove into electronic productions with a steel determination and has been doing it for over 10 years.\n\u201cIt first hit me when once 18 I stumbled upon a rave party in the mountains. I lived in a city between Venice and the alps, where many of those illegal raves were being organised. There and then I was instantly mind-blown by the energy of the music controlling the crowd. The next day I was already producing with my first set and performing on stage in one year.\u201d\nHis music is a curation of combined post-rock feel of melancholy, the energy of rave and the heavy base of techno.",

    "/dj/2000andone": "Vision and versatility - the DNA that defines 2000 and One as an artist. Whether he\u2019s performing for 40,000 housecrowds, 2500 techno lovers or 400 party people at an intimate, underground tech-house club, he\u2019ll always cook the dancefloor. \n \n2000 And One (aka Dylan Hermelijn) has been on the forefront of electronic dance music since the late eighties. His pioneering vision across more than two decades of music genres, now ranks him as one the most versatile, in-demand international artists, commanding weekly performances on the house, techno and techhouse global club and festival circuits. \n\nNot only recognised as a magnet for the clubbing crowds, 2000 and One is also credited for championing the sounds of Amsterdam\u2019s new school DJ and Producer generation and propelling the scene\u2019s visibility into the international club headlights. \n\nBased in Amsterdam, his involvement with six of the city\u2019s finest techno, techhouse and house labels - 100% Pure, Remote Area, Area Remote, Intacto (with Shinedoe), Bitten and Bangbang! (with Sandy H\u00fcner) has offered a framework for the new generation of producers to hit the world stage. Collectively these labels have offered a staggering amount of underground dance anthems and it\u2019s therefore no surprise that he\u2019s recently been hailed as the inspiration for Amsterdam\u2019s new sound generation, as well as the glue that binds it. \n\nInfluenced by a hiphop background, it all began in the late eighties, when heavily infected by the acid house bug he produced his first record at 17 under his moniker 2000 And One. A passion for musical diversity saw him release across other genres such as ambient & drum n bass before he became one of the first successful Dutch technoproducers, as well as one of the first in this genre to perform live. \n\nIn 1993 he launched 100% Pure Records with schoolmate and music partner in crime Sandy H\u00fcner.  Now heading up the label solo, it is internationally recognized as Amsterdam\u2019s longest running techhouse imprint and its foundations have paved the way for the success of his other labels. \n\nIn 2005, his epic stomper Adonai Elohim (2005) caught the eye of technofreaks around the globe. Then Tropical Melons (2006) became a massive festival hit, as well as Microfunk\u2019s contemporary techno classic Pecan (2006), then Rare Tap (2009) scorched the international club systems. 2009 also welcomed the release of his debut album Heritage, a powerful homage to the timelessness of house music and picked up by many as one of the best house / techno albums of that year. \n\nAlthough his past accomplishments have made international sound waves, the new decade has witnessed a sonic boom of recent achievements - and like every sonic boom, there's an enormous amount of sound energy that is unleashed. That's why in 2011 you'll find his point of view with numerous remixes including his Defected remix of the house classic 4 You by 4th Measure Man as well as a bestseller collaboration with Sandy Huner - Tap Deux on Remote Area, 2 classics covered on his vinyl only Kreamm release on BangBang! plus his first solo EP since his album, Analogue Dreams on 100% Pure.\n\nOutside of his own studio he's presented his Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1 and moved to the Defected House with a series of mixes, releasing a new sound energy that has propelled him to the global party hotspots across Europe and the Americas as well as debut in Russia and return to Japan.  The white island called again for an exclusive summer residency at Ibiza\u2019s Amnesia with Eric Prydz (Tonight), furthermore the Sensation madness that began in 2010 has continued with his back-to-back sessions with Joris Voorn,  driving the 40.000 party people insane.  And to ensure that more clubbers experience the madness, he's strengthened his bookings crew by joining The Bullitt Agency for his America gigs, complementing his worldwide bookings with agency Kazz_ema and his Dutch bookings with new agent Fire in the Disco.\n\nClearly as the decade progresses there's no sign of the 2000 and One's sonic boom silencing as he propels himself forward to break new sound barriers in the world of electronic dance music. \nAdonai Elohim (2005)\nTropical Melons (2006)\nPecan (2006) - Microfunk\nRare Tap (2009)\nHeritage Album (2009)\nTap Deux (2011)",

    "/dj/2boy": "This paper does not claim to be an exhaustive representation of all artists of Minimal Art and Minimal Music up to the present day (2005). The author rather tries to specify Minimalist manifestations in art and music on the basis of important criteria and distinguished artists and discusses them in a common context, draws connections between them and realises the thereby gained findings auditorily and visually. This realisation can be received via the attached Audio CD as well as through the artworks at the beginning of each chapter. All pieces of music have been composed, arranged and produced by the author. The same is true of the artworks which have been designed autonomously, in order to achieve the highest possible individual involvement with the material. At this point it seems reasonable to cast an eye on a problem that arose in the course of the research. Throughout the history of art and music style definitions have faced the challenge to assign a highly varying mass of artworks to a specific cultural movement. As for Minimalism the problem is even more significant since it is still debatable in art criticism if paintings and objects represent the principles of Minimalism likewise. Painting basically concentrates on the reduction of monochromatic and serially structured pictures, while in spatial art the object quality, the resulting spatial perspective and the critical relation between art and exhibition site play a decisive role. The present paper focuses on objects, since some significant characteristics of Minimalism, like object quality and perspective, apply only to them. As noted above, a digression to some areas of Minimalism beyond Minimal Art and Minimal Music will be made at this point. However, it will be confined to a short definition and a description of the most renowned artists. Although the presented works are generally to be seen in the context of their own movement it seems reasonable to briefly discuss the Minimalist approaches of other musical and artistic styles, so as to establish cross connections to Minimal Art and Minimal Music.",

But there\u2019s much more to the two brothers than meets the eye. Apart from being chairman of the Belgian Carpenters Association (Stephen) and having a black belt in tae kwon do (David), they are also masters in blending the finest products of music history together into a catchy, hilarious and -above all- intriguing groove exploration. From politically incorrect prog-rock to funky r&b, from trendy hiptrop to banging German techno, ja: if it gets a booty going, the Dewaele brothers have it in their record collection. \n\nBlending beautiful tunes is far from new for the Soulwax brothers. Back in the dark days of 1999, David and Stephen started a DJ-show on Belgian national radio, called \u2018Hang The DJ\u2019, where they did exactly that. Years before bootlegging reached the trendy pages of The Face, they were already making their own mixes for inclusion on the show. Inspired by the philosophy of one Grandmaster Flash, they cut together the best bits of funky tracks into an even funkier mix. It was then that classic mixes of Blackstreet with Grandmaster Flash, Beck with Prodigy and Beastie Boys vs. Herbie Hancock with INXS vs. AC/DC saw the light of day. Praise the Lord.\n\nAfter having wooed Belgian and Dutch crowds for a few years with these eclectic sets, they went on to impress the most cynical part of the world, the London scene, a loud yet harmless species. The British capital, where approximately 67% of the population (including 17% of women over 65) owns two decks and a mixer, is used to a thing or two, but Stephen and David immediately raised quite a few eyebrows with sparkling sets for London\u2019s independent radio station Xfm, national institution BBC Radio 1 and appearances at the renowned Trash nights in London and Arthur Baker\u2019s Sunday Sessions in The Elbow Room.\n\nImpact on the trendometer: a fat 9.5. \u201cWhen we played our first set for Xfm\u201d, says David, \u201cseveral club owners phoned up during the transmission to ask us to come and play their venues.\u201d And when an (unnamed) DJ played Soulwax\u2019s classic bootleg mix of Skee-Lo\u2019s \u2018I Wish\u2019, Survivor\u2019s \u2018Eye Of The Tiger\u2019 and The Breeders\u2019 \u2018Cannonball\u2019 at a London club night and pretended he was mixing it himself, it became official: Soulwax was hot property. Even Jarvis Cocker showed his appreciation for their skills and none other than \u00fcber-producer Felix Da Housecat invited the brothers to collaborate on his new project: a girlband called Glamarama. You gotta believe it\u2026\n\nNo surprise then that \u20182 Many DJ\u2019s\u2019 has been in the pipeline for yonks, but because getting tracks cleared is a legal war zone, it has taken quite a bit longer. \u201cMick Jones from The Clash was very impressed with our bootleg version of their \u2018The Magnificent Seven\u2019 mixed with Basement Jaxx\u2019s \u2018Romeo\u2019\u201d, explains Stephen, \u201cbut still we didn\u2019t manage to secure the rights to include it on the album\u201d. Rumours that two lawyers have been decapitated since are unconfirmed.\nToo bad, but there\u2019s more than enough magic material to keep you intrigued, smiling and shaking. The record includes already renowned mixes like Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s \u2018Independent Women\u2019 with 10CC\u2019s \u2018Dreadlock Holiday\u2019 and Stooges\u2019 \u2018No Fun\u2019 with Salt \u2018N\u2019 Pepa\u2019s \u2018Push It\u2019, but it also features new beautiful blends like R\u00f6yksopp\u2019s \u2018Eple\u2019 with Dolly Parton\u2019s \u2018Nine To Five\u2019 and Basement Jaxx\u2019s \u2018Where\u2019s Your Head At\u2019 with Emerson Lake & Palmer\u2019s \u2018Theme From Peter Gun\u2019. \n\nTongue-in-cheek is the first thing that springs to mind when reading these names, but if you peel off the first, obvious layer, you have to admit that these \u2018cheesy\u2019 mixes actually do work. Mixing 45 songs together in one hour of music is one thing. But making that hour a consistent exploration of the history of pop music is quite another. \u20182 Many DJ\u2019s\u2019 makes you laugh, yes indeed, but it also covers left, right, top and bottom of groovy pop. Some of the tracks on this album are obvious classics, some are simply unknown and some will very soon become hot sought-after gems. From Japanese geisha Hanayo covering \u2018Joe le Taxi\u2019, 21st century proof electro from Adult., Finnish disco from Ural 13 Diktators or sleazy Peaches to classics from The Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Residents, Sly And The Family Stone and Nena. They\u2019re all there for a reason. \n\u20182 Many DJ\u2019s\u2019 proves that \u2018genre\u2019 has never been such a naff word.",

    "/dj/4yo4u": "4Yo4U was created on March 11, 2011 in Moscow by Aibo, Didi, Kodek and Key-D.\n\n Didi has loved graffiti and electronic music since he was a kid. He loves Kraftwerk most of all. Didi used to mix tracks with CD-decks and a mixer with a microprocessor when he had free time between graffiti projects. But he didn\u2019t really love that because he wanted to make his own music.\n\n Aibo loves graffiti too, but he hated electronic music. His favorite music genres are funk and reggae. When Aibo was a student of Moscow University of Design, he created a reggae-band with his friends where he played keyboards. But this band had a rapid breakdown.\n\n Aibo and Didi met each other in Key-D\u2019s (Aibo\u2019s wife) flat. At that time, Key-D was preparing to become a laboratory assistant in the sound department of Moscow University of Cinema. Because of that, one of Key-D\u2019s friends gave her a KORG EMX-1. It was the entrance into electronic music for Aibo and for Didi, the way to make his own music. They created a musical group called \u201cYoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo\u201d, and all members of that group played only one instrument.\n\n Two weeks after their group was created, they were invited to play in \u201cVozduh\u201d club at a techno-party dedicated to graffiti. That is how Yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo confirmed their music genre and their future destiny. Their first tracks were not made in a specific genre. These tracks were called \u201cFighting Chinese Boys\u201d and sounded roughly as if Peaches and Arthur Baker were producing a compilation of Modern Talking remixes.\n\n In Vozduh, they met Kodek a.k.a. Diod212 who was invited to play at the same gig. It is no secret that Kodek loves graffiti. He started to mix tracks from vinyl in 1996 and was a resident of \u201cX-Dance\u201d club for some years. The minimalistic sound of the Detroit school was his favorite style. In early 2000, Kodek moved towards self-production but did not forgot about DJ-ing.\n\n By accident, Yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo squeezed into Kodek\u2019s DJ-set during a live improvisation jam, as a result of which, people on the dance floor started to fight. Since that moment, Aibo, Didi, Key-D and Kodek decided to work together and shortened the name of the group to \u201c4Yo4U\u201d.\n\nSince then, Aibo has definitely become interested in techno. He has learned new skills of music making with the KORG EMX-1. The sound of \u201cFighting Chinese Boys\u201d has evolved to minimal sound. At the same time, Didi got a KORG-KO1 and became a master of this device, hence widening the musical horizons of 4Yo4U and becoming a starting point to making their own studio. In this way, their sound quality has increased.\n\n At present, 4Yo4U has recorded lots of tracks and this number increases every day. At every gig, you can listen to new tunes that have never been heard before. 4Yo4U like to combine live performance with DJ-sets and because of that, old tracks sound new.\nAmbush - RFSD008\nInvasion - MINUSmin6\nminMAX - MINUSminMAX1",

Initially defined to many with their breakthrough singles \"Pacific\", \"Cubik\" and \"In Yer Face\", released across fine imprints such as ZTT and the Tommy Boy in the United States, the band were the first electronica band to craft long form dance music albums, well before the likes of Leftfield and Orbital to whom they are often compared released their debut LPs.\nRealising early on that the future of dance music lay with the album format, 808 State came to issue genre defining LP's from their first with ZTT Records \"Ninety\", which came to characterise that period of early acid house. Then as part of the explosion of Manchester artists, the band began to cross over to rock and indie crowds, something that then found its way into their music with their next, the still hugely rated release, 1991's double album \"ex:el\". \nAcross their subsequent albums \"Gorgeous\", \"Don Solaris\" and then \"Output Transmission\", 808 continued to experiment with new forms and styles, bringing drum and bass and other elements to techno whilst always seeking to move forward and create.\nThe band were also the first to bring in guest vocalists across their output and have collaborated with the likes of Bjork, Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield, Elbow's Guy Garvey and a whole host of others which set the format for many subsequent cross over indie / dance tracks.\nNow based at Old Granada Studios in Manchester, recording new material, it is the ongoing inventiveness, sense of adventure and their well-honed production craft that have kept 808 State at the top of their production games throughout their career.\nAs one of the very first fully live techno acts to hit the road, their live reputation has always been formidable with recent concerts at the likes of London's Printworks and Moogfest in North Carolina highlighting that they remain one of dance music's best live performers.",

    "/dj/a.paul": "A.Paul was born in Lisbon, Portugal in November 1971, and his career started in 1986, although his first contact with music was made at a very early stage, mainly through the hands of his older sister that would regularly listen to disco, funk, and electro sounds in the 70\u2032s. From a music passionate mind, to a national celebrity, A.Paul is today one of the key players of the electronic music scene on a worldwide scale, both as a DJ and as a Producer. His taste, technique and originality made him earn the respect from his peers and most of all the love and devotion from his fans.\n\nAfter the first years of musical discovery, his talent start to blossom when he was 13, despite living in a country where only a small percentage of people would listen to dance music, he always knew that these infectious rhythms would be on his path. After buying his first decks and mixer, including a couple of years of bedroom practice, he organized a few parties himself and later acquired his first residencies in clubs, through the hand of J.Daniel, who was one of the most respected Portuguese DJs in the 90\u2032s. He was the owner of Question of Time Records, a vanguard record shop and record label, where A.Paul would later release his first record \u201cJuice\u201d a remarkable masterpiece that was played by many top DJs worldwide and licensed to various labels and compilations. He was also invited to be part of the Climacz project, the first after-hours club in Portugal, which was one of the first milestones of his career. The amazing spirit this venue brought to the Portuguese scene is still remembered with great joy and nostalgia by A.Paul himself.\n\nAt some point he felt the need to move on and search for new challenges. In 1996, he became part of the Illegal Records project as a techno import manager, was invited to be resident of the best club at that time Kremlin, and later founded his first labels, Squeeze Records and Onh.Cet, which were two relevant projects that helped define and polish his sound. By then he was also already playing quite a lot as freelancer, in a growing market. Portugal was at its peak, in terms of electronic music popularity and A.Paul was playing at one point every weekend on different parts of the country. It was inevitable that he would decide to stick to this option for his career, as opposed to be resident in a club, where he would be more limited in terms of music taste.\n\nIn 1997 he joins the X-Club, the most important DJ Agency and party organizer in Portugal. All the top cats were signed to X-Club, and so was A.Paul, first as a supporting artist, and later part of the agency\u2019s top artists too. This period was very important for A.Paul, and his growth was remarkable, because he had the chance to meet and play with all the major techno and house artists in the world. Other projects developed by A.Paul at that time include sound engineering, journalism and also graphic and web design, activities that would become also important on his next projects.\n\nA.Paul was voted best Portuguese techno DJ in 2000, 2001, and 2002 by the readers of Dance Club, the main electronic music media vehicle in Portugal. A.Paul has never stopped investing and supporting the electronic music community particularly in techno. This is when A.Paul decides to start exploring the international market, due to the changes in the Portuguese scene.1994 to 2000 was monumental time after suffering from the huge decline in quality and quantity of events and musical culture. From the \u201cParadise Called Portugal\u201d coined years before by international media, Portugal was now a place with a stagnated scene, and techno was probably the first genre to suffer. It was time for change, this crisis lead him to invest his time in a music production career, that was quiet for a few years due to the higher demand for DJ previously. In 2001 he opened Genesis record shop. Later in 2007 A.Paul was co-owner of MPC Vinyl Distribution, with his long-time friends Cisco Ferreira (The Advent) and Michaelangelo, where he also released on his other sub -labels The Light, Parallel 125, Dirty Ego, LK and Xtractz.\n\nIn In 2012 A.Paul\u2019s most renowned & most successful project to date is Naked Lunch Records which was created back in 2005 really began to really take mold into one of the driving forces in the techno scene. Naked Lunch Podcast, a weekly podcast, which is a careful balance of top quality underground DJs and the game changers in the techno scene.\n\nFast forward to 2013, this marked a new monumental moment in A.Paul\u2019s career as a promoter, by the end of the year he had 5 success events under his belt! With the success of the highly acclaimed Naked Lunch Nights in Portugal, its natural step would be to take his events international for 2014, alongside the grand opening of the much anticipated Naked Lunch Agency, the missing puzzle piece to complete his techno vision & one day his legacy.\n\nA.Paul has released over 100 vinyl records, several mixed CD compilations released in amazing labels like; Kombination Research, Synewave, Planet Rhyhtm, Italo Business, Pure Sonik, Theory, Mastertraxx, Beat Disaster, Yin Yang, Impact Mechanics, and has remixed artists such as The Advent, Ben Sims, Eric Sneo, Angel Alanis, Damon Wild, DJ T-1000, Virgil Enzinger, Robert Armani, Dave The Drummer, Dj Preach, Mike Humphries, Spiros Kaloumenos, Torsten Kanzler, Bas Mooy, Housemaster Boyz and many more.\n\nBesides his sound of hard, funky, deep bass lines he is renowned for, he has also been known productions in tech- house, minimal and experimental sounds, under several aliases like Loudon Kleer, Luther Miek, Beat Therapy and LK. and last but not least, he is also known for his co-productions with artists like The Advent, Industrialyzer, Michaelangelo, DJ Slot among others.\n\nHis unique sound, taste, and technique, granted him a position on some of the best mega events like; Awakenings, Chateau Techno, TGV (The Netherlands), Evolve (Canada), Nature One, Syndicate, Ruhr in Love (Germany), Rock in Rio (Portugal), Technolandia (Portugal), Aquasella, (Spain), Liberty White (Belgium), Decibel (Holland), Global Vision Festival (France) & Apokalypsa (Czech Republic).\nA.Paul has rocked some of the hottest clubs like; Tresor, U60311, Lehmann (Germany), Sullivan Room (USA), Fabrik , Makumba, Row 14, Moog, Industrial Copera (Spain), Perron, Panama, Poema (The Netherlands), Locomia , Rocks, Kremlin, Pacha (Portugal), Qube (Italy), Inox Club (France) & many more.\nPlease visit: http://apaul.com/apaulsite/?page_id=23",

In whichever realm he works, the Brooklyn-bred artist intertwines a soulful commonality into his electronic sound. Its house music understood on all levels.\n\nAaron began his career in the heyday of the 90's NYC rave & club scene and spent his formative years promoting famed New York Clubs Tunnel, Twilo, Vinyl and Limelight. Eventually, he relocated to Philadelphia, where he began regularly DJing & producing events at local and regional clubs. Throughout his time in Philadelphia, Aaron laid the proverbial house music soundtrack to weekly crowds and eventually came to co-create the SunDae brand alongside Lee Jones & DJ Dirty. SunDae, one of Philly's longest running, ongoing, and prolific house event brands, has become a \"must play\" stop for artists such as Hector Romero, Andy Caldwell, and JoJo Flores as well as hometown heroes like Josh Wink, Questlove of the Legendary Roots crew, King Britt, and Rich Medina.  \n\nIn early 2004, Aaron translated the success of his promotional career into the launch of a new music label, Dae Recordings. Unlike his own, self-branded style of \u201csoulful funk,\u201d Aaron signed on house tracks rooted deeper in uptempo grooves. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be funky,\u201d he said on signing tracks for his Dae imprint. After a twenty release stint featuring house heavyweights like Derrick Carter, Onionz, Johnny Fiasco, Greenskeepers, Julius Papp, Manuel Tur, Miles Maeda, and Schmoov!, Dae still continues to garner massive support from industry tastemakers worldwide.  \n\nIn 2005, Aaron deepened his own music career by relocating to Chicago. Producing and performing in the House music epicenter pushed both Aaron and Dae Recordings further into the forefront of the music scene, sharing the stage with Chicago classics like Mark Farina, Derrick L. Carter, Glenn Underground, Mark Grant, Terry Hunter, Ron Carroll, and Diz. In addition to dropping his spacey, soulful sound on audiences, he continues promoting events across the country. At Miami\u2019s annual Winter Music Conference, Aaron successfully hosted \u201cFloatin\u2019\u201d for two consecutive years. The sold-out luxury yacht vessel carried 300-plus party-goers and featured three separate rooms of live DJs. His current outdoor daytime events at WMC and the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Afternoon Delight, Do You Wanna Boogie?, and Now In Stereo, have been rated by Mixmag in the top 5 daytime parties (alongside massives like Ultra) and are considered to be some of the year's most anticipated events. From Lovebirds, Vincenzo, and Crazy P to Marques Wyatt, Jamie Lewis, and Dj Spinna, Aaron has continued to push the creative envelope within his events. \n\nWhile Aaron draws influences from the classic likes of Masters At Work, Todd Terry and Joey Negro, he also infuses elements of electronic soul. Artists such as Crazy P, Spirit Catcher, Hot Toddy and Lovebirds have all defined an aspect of his playing style. The result is a deep house blend of disco, funk, soul and space. \n\nIn 2010, Aaron has relocated back to \"the city that never sleeps\" and focused his attentions towards a slew of new event productions as well as launching the new Razor \u2013N- Tape edits label + podcast with, Tortured Soul & Escort's own, JKriv.

    "/dj/abdullarashim": "The cohesive array of depth charged devices that Anthony Linell has produced is formidable. From his opening statements as Abdulla Rashim on his early label of the same name, right through to his recent work that puts his aliases aside, there is a robust and rigorous intent that compounds the elemental strategies of techno's models to apprehend his singular vision.\n\nPresiding over Stockholm's Northern Electronics label with Varg (Jonas R\u00f6nnberg), Linell dispenses with mechanisms of attention on all fronts. Marked by an indefatigable self-reliance, the label presents exactly what it means to display, and no more. Carving an idiosyncratic platform for his music is as great of a warning as there could be that Linell's leveraging little toward the benefit of the audience. By his measure, the familiarity and comfort of contemporary techno is stripped back to its rushing heart, the senses left tailgating the strobe in a fit of intuition over decision. The greater this is exposed the colder it gets, and its in these extremes that Linell's caustic rhythmic precision hits. Live, it comes off as a galvanizing strike from the outside; analysing the room as a DJ, it's a case of being pursued through the dark. \n\nJust as the brevity of Linell's output in the eyes of techno is exalted as it is brought into focus, the background to this blurs as you start to decipher his other projects. Lundin Oil skirts the fringes of noise and experimental music, and in collaboration with Varg as Ulwhedar, this is perhaps even more pronounced.\n\nPurposively ricocheting between the techno world and experimental electronic music, Linell forges a distinct passage that gathers the aesthetically uncompromising motifs and missions from across this spectrum. It's this combination and resolve that's brought Linell to the world's attention, however little that attention has been solicited.",
    "/dj/abeduque": "ABE DUQUE IS IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.\n\nThe name is pronounced \u201cDu-kay\u201d. He jokingly describes himself as one of the \"few producers still licenced to use the 303\". But with a career that started in the early days of house at New York's notorious Limelight, Abe Duque has been at the head of the acid-house and underground-techno table since his earliest releases way back in 1993.\n\nHis first tracks were influenced by the madness of the Limelight's club-kid audience, later publicised by films and books like Party Monster and Clubland Confidential. But despite jokey titles like \"Fantastico!!!\", \"Truckers Choice\" and \"Vodka, you sweet companion,\" his early tracks had the sophistication of his serious keyboard skills and a get-in-and-do-it-yourself aesthetic learned as a kid growing up in the suburbs in Hollis in Queens, New York.\n\nFrom muscular and melodic techno to cocktail jazz and ambient interludes, his early tracks on his own labels Tension and Hollis Haus, his releases under pseudonyms like Kirilan, Super Secret Symphony and his releases on others' labels like Disko B, Rapture!, Morbid, and Tresor captured a particular period of clubbing history bought to a sudden halt when the Limelight was closed down by the cops.\n\nIt was, Duque says, a great time for musical experimentation. Each month bought radical new types of music kit - much of which Duque still keeps in use in his underground studio \"the Cave\" - alongside an amazement of now classic tracks and new acts.\n\nAnd as techno was almost exclusively made by working musicians, a lot of it was performed live. At Duque\u2019s night at the Limelight night, Abuse Industries, he was part of regular performances with the live techno \"chillout supergroup\" the Rancho Relaxo Allstars, freeform jams which included now famous techno producers like Duque himself, John Selway and Deitrich Shoenemann. For a short spell, Duque was also the keyboard player for Program2, a techno band signed to Warners for an advance Duque still describes as \u201cinsane\u201d.\n\nAbuse Industries itself, meanwhile, was Abe's collaboration with the artist Andy Orel, a night so strikingly visual and challenging that its visuals were exhibited in European museums, given page after page in Germany's Raveline magazine, and used in shows by Helmut Lang.\n\nBut when the Limelight closed, that roughly marked the end of New York as a clubbing mecca. New mayor Rudolph Guiliani was determined to drive the freaks, the gays and the wasted out of his town, and he mostly succeeded.\n\nDuque by then had a thriving European and worldwide touring schedule, and musicially he still had roots in the underground. Abandoning the glossy, high-fashion style of Tension and Abuse Industries, Duque\u2019s next sets of releases were on anonymous, vinyl only stamped with catalogue numbers like \"ADR40\" [Abe Duque Records 40] and etched on one side at the pressing plant with strange, hand-drawn messages from the man himself.\n\nIn some ways Duque was turning his back on the New York style, and on his previous successes. As he describes it, \"I wanted to prove that my music spoke for itself\". It did. Despite the secrecy about who had actually written the ADR releases, this second part of Duque's career was a run of increasingly massive 12\" hits like Champagne Days, Cocaine Nights; Acid, Disco Nights, and in 2004 his monster smash with Blake Baxter, \"What Happened?\", the track that launched Duque and Baxter out of the underground and into the spotlight. That track's call for a turn away from safe, unchallenging clubbing sold 25,000 copies on vinyl alone and in 2009, it was the focus of a rare remix competition on ResidentAdvisor - despite Duque and Baxter's refusal to market the track by signing it to any the 100s of compilations on offer.\n\nHaving been dragged out of the underground, Duque found himself feted by the mainstream, delivering hugely successful remixes of acts like the Chemical Brothers and Pet Shop Boys while continuing to work right across the techno world. There, his brutally funky basslines and acid influence were \u2013 and still are - hugely in demand for remixes of acts such as Miss Kittin, Remute, Chloe, Savas Pascalidis, Knart IV and Daniel Meteo \u2013 as well as DJ Hell, with Duque becoming a regular on Hell's Gigolos label. The two had met having moving in the same German and NY electronic circles since the Abuse Industries days, and so Duque was asked to produce Hell's infamous album NY Muscle in 2003 and in 2006 to helm the well-recieved \"American Gigolos II\" compilation.\n\nThe highlight of this period, though, was Duque's first album under his own name, \"So Underground It Hurts\". The title was yet another example of Duque's ambivalence about succcess and its trappings, but the album was undeniably a techno event. Reviewed in the fashion press as influenced by Gigolos' German electroclash style, but the album was understood by the music press as something quite separate and self-contained.\n\nDuque was again striking out along his own path. Part wild acid, part dark house and all leavened with Duque's dry, quiet stoner humour, the album also provided a launchpad for Duque's return to wild live performances \u2013 a whiskey bottle in one hand and a 303, drum machine, two PCs and a microphone operated by the other.\n\nIt was the start of Duque\u2019s second, endless round of watching the world through the windows of a hotel and moving restlessly between a temporary flat in Berlin and his spiritual home in Queens. Several years on the road with his stable of vocalists \u2013 Blake Baxter, Tijiana T, Acid Maria, Virginia, and occasional appearances by Abuse collaborator Andy Orel as \u201cSin\u201d \u2013 meant that Abe released only intermittently on his own label, Abe Duque Records. There, new tracks like the darkly funny It Moved Me, Whose Got the Flave, and a singles collection on CD When the Fever Breaks added to Duque\u2019s reputation as the producers\u2019 producer.\n\nEventually, though, Duque had had enough of continual touring. By 2008 he said he had been doing live sets for so long that he \"was thinking about DJing again for a change, just as everyone else was going live\u201d. Returning to the studio, he wrote the album Don\u2019t Be So Mean, its title an oblique reference to the Iraq war and US foreign policy.\n\nThe cover? Duque on the front brandishing a machine gun - and the same machine gun pointing straight at Duque inside. Released in 2009, the album offered optimism about Obama (\u201cTonight is your answer\u201d), let Blake Baxter loose on the dance scene in a response to What Happened? called Let\u2019s Take It Back, and also marked Duque\u2019s return to leftfield electronics with tracks like OFMA and Salute the Dawn, which threw together Debussy with lyrics by 1800s American revolutionary and moralist Thoreau.\n\nDon\u2019t Be So Mean was also the stepping stone to Abe\u2019s three new projects in 2010. The first, due May 2010, will be a compilation LIVE AND ON ACID: two CDs, one of his live show, and one a wrap-up of Limelight acid-house classics. The second, under the broad church of Abuse Industries, is the return of the Abuse Industries night, and a series of sinner-themed Abuse 12\u201ds in collaboration with Andy Orel \u2013 see abuseindustries.net for more.\n\nAnd finally, Duque's third new project is a secret performance project that leaves the dancefloor world entirely.\n\nLast year, Abe Duque was in the mood for love, and he said \"Don\u2019t Be So Mean\".

Well known for their upfront mixing style and the ability to take the crowd on a musical journey, they are true party rockers on the decks. AB Logic & Chris Love pride themselves on bringing fun, positive vibes, and quality beats to every night club they're exposed to. Their vast history in dance music allows them to seamlessly navigate through different styles of quality House & Techno music, dropping everything from unreleased tunes by today\u2019s most cutting edge producers, to rare classics, to their own self-produced cuts. They released their debut single \u201cRighteous Way\u201d on the world famous King Street Sounds record label and haven\u2019t looked back since. 2015 saw massive records from Love & Logic including hit singles \u201cBig Booty Bitches\u201d on Riva Starr\u2019s Snatch! Recordings, and \u201cBicycle Seat\u201d on the storied Guesthouse Music label. After 2 years of planning they recently launched the SOUP record label which looks to be one of the most promising new labels of 2016. Between their heavy skills in the DJ booth and top notch selection, Love & Logic are an act you never want to miss.\n\nAB Logic has been a regular face on east coast DJ lineups since the late 90\u2019s. He was previously known for his role as \u00bd of the Hoodfellas production duo, who released music on Classic Music Company, Hudd Traxx, Guesthouse, Greenskeepers, Sampled, and Smoke City Music, just to name a few. AB was also co-owner and A&R of the now defunct Smoke City Music vinyl record label. \n\nWith SOUP quickly growing, Chris & AB officially joined forces as Love & Logic back in 2011 and saw immediate success as a duo. They currently hold an official monthly SOUP DJ residency at NYC\u2019s world renowned Cielo nightclub, make regular appearances at the highly regarded Output & Verboten venues, and have cracked into the festival circuit with a monster set at NYC\u2019s 2015 Electric Daisy Carnival. Their steady release schedule and regular DJ appearances at Americas top venues have quickly helped Love & Logic become some of the US\u2019s fastest rising DJ talents.\nLove & Logic have released on Snatch!, King Street, Guesthouse, SOUP, Street King, & more.\n\nDiscography \nHoodfellas Releases:\n Bear Who?

    "/dj/above-beyond": "The best moment at ABGT250, Above & Beyond\u2019s skyscraping open-air festival staged in front of 23,000 fans at Washington state\u2019s Gorge Amphitheatre in September? Ask the three men at the heart of it, you get three different answers. \n\nPaavo Siljam\u00e4ki: \u201cOne day I was having lunch on my own in the winery \u2013 I know, a winery! \u2013 next to The Gorge and heard these two couples chatting. They didn\u2019t know each other beforehand, but as I sat there eavesdropping I realised I was listening to them becoming friends. They\u2019d been drawn together by ABGT250. That was the essence of the weekend for me.\"\n\nJono Grant: \"I was in a car heading off the site with [singer] Zo\u00eb Johnston, and there was a long stream of fans leaving The Gorge. Zo\u00eb and I asked the driver to stop the car on a bridge that was above the flowing river of fans, and we got and waved goodbye to them as the walked through the tunnel. Everyone were screaming like crazy and it was a really fun moment. It never ceases to amaze me both how much love and dedication the fans have towards it all.\u201d\n\nTony McGuinness: \u201cPaavo was doing an 11am yoga set and I went with him. So, 2000 people in front of the yoga stage doing the downward dog, then a couple thousand more just enjoying the tunes he was playing, then a six-abreast stream of people in Anjunabeats and Above & Beyond t-shirts walking from the campsite \u2013 seeing all that for the first time, and seeing our family, if you like, in broad daylight and bright sunshine, brought home to me the enormity of our community. They were coming together in the spirit of openness and warmth and music. Let\u2019s just say I was glad I was wearing sunglasses because, honestly, I was choking up.\u201d\n\nThree answers, one unifying theme: for their latest (ad)venture, hosted to mark their 250th Group Therapy radio show, Above & Beyond had crystallised something that lay at the heart of everything they\u2019ve achieved over their 17 years together. From developing that groundbreaking radio show to touring the world\u2019s best clubs and most illustrious venues; from establishing a thriving, multi-artist label to building a peerless catalogue of artist albums; from creating iconic dance anthems to curating soulful acoustic rerubs, one thing stands out.\nThat is: Above & Beyond have carved out a unique space in music and culture, one that reaches far beyond their electronic roots. In so doing, Jono, Paavo and Tony have created something special: a common ground where all sorts of people and ideas can come together. Celebration, kinship, community \u2013 it\u2019s the A&B way.\n\nPresenting, then, Common Ground. The trio\u2019s fourth electronic album is the follow-up to 2015\u2019s Grammy-nominated We Are All We Need, and comes in the wake of sell-out shows at totemic venues ranging from Colorado\u2019s Red Rocks Amphitheatre to London\u2019s O2. It features a quartet of guest vocalists, a couple of them longstanding members of the family, a couple of them valued newcomers. And it\u2019s an album born from everything they\u2019ve done so far, most recently the glorious Gorge happening and the band\u2019s 2016 orchestral tour in support of their second acoustic album.  \n\n\u201cWe were just absolutely spoiled with every venue on that tour,\u201d says a still-buzzing Paavo. \u201cThe Sydney Opera House was emotional because that was the end of the whole tour. But I never thought we could do a show at a Broadway theatre, or the Hollywood Bowl or the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 the ultimate homecoming gig for any band based in London. It was really the stuff of dreams.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was great opportunity to make real in a live band universe \u2013 which means a lot to me \u2013 everything we\u2019ve done with Above & Beyond so far,\u201d continues Tony. \u201cUs playing keyboards and guitars, and all those live strings and horns, consolidated my fantasy about everything Above & Beyond can and should be.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to writing the songs for their next album, that tour, he adds, had an immediate, \nfreeing impact.\n\n\u201cThe success of the acoustic tour has relaxed us even more in terms of what we can do and what we can use.\u201d\n\nLess than 18 months since the end that most recent world tour, and only two months since The Gorge, an energised and invigorated Above & Beyond are already almost ready for their next chapter. The finishing touches are being made to Common Ground in the band\u2019s London studio, but the songs are already firmly in place.\n\nAn early keeper was the heartfelt, bittersweet Cold Feet, written and recorded with returning vocalist Justine Suissa in Paavo\u2019s new studio in his Finnish homeland. \u201cBy the end of summer 2016 we had had some really good writing sessions,\u201d he explains. \"Then Justine came over to Finland in January to write songs with me. We were swimming in a frozen lake, then popping indoors to write a song with a piano and a mic in this totally isolated place. It was a fantastic place to be creative together.\" \n\nBeyond that, two teaser tracks have already been rapturously received. First up is the bleak-but-beautiful Tightrope, a big club track that Tony wrote with Martin Longstaff. \u201cI met Marty at Chris Difford\u2019s songwriting workshop at Glastonbury a couple years ago. I was just blown away by him.\u201d Welcomed into the A&B brood as a guest vocalist, his writing skills were too good an opportunity for the ever-curious band to pass by. \u201cWriting Tightrope together was a fantastic experience, and it just shows a slightly different side to us. It\u2019s quite dark but still glorious because of his angelic voice.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the euphoric My Own Hymn, which features A&B favourite Zo\u00eb Johnston. \u201cShe\u2019s just an absolute thrill to work with,\u201d says Paavo, \u201cand to see how her mind works \u2013 she\u2019s one of the most creative people I know. And that song is really a result of one of these days where we just sit down with some ideas and at the end of the day we have a song.\u201d \n\nTony describes Common Ground\u2019s second single as his favourite track on the album. \u201cAs well as being this wonderful earth mother to all of us, Zo\u00eb has a lovely independent streak. And this song puts into words that feeling that everyone can write their own script if they want to. It has depth and a fantastic inspirational side. We\u2019re so lucky to have her in the band.\u201d\n\nNow, teeing up the album\u2019s January 2018 release \u2013 as well as a pair of landmark, turn-of-the-year shows at New York\u2019s Barclays Centre and the Los Angeles Convention Centre (followed by a full spring US tour) \u2013 comes new single Northern Soul. Tony wrote it in 2014 after the band shot the On A Good Day video in Detroit. He wanted to hymn the qualities of a once great, then neglected and now resurgent heartland American city. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of hope when you go to Detroit now,\u201d he notes, \u201cand I knew I wanted to write a song about that.\u201d \n\nLess immediately clear was who would be the singer. Exploring all their options, the band tried out (in Tony\u2019s estimation) ten singers. All were great in their own ways, but none fitted the bill exactly. Then he had the brainwave of sounding out one of the trio\u2019s foundational singers. Richard Bedford was the voice of some of Above & Beyond\u2019s cornerstone songs, notably Sun & Moon and Thing Called Love, before going off to do his own thing.  \n\n\u201cI just thought, sod it, I\u2019ll give him a shout, see if he\u2019s up for coming back,\u201d relates Tony. He was, and he did, \u201cand it immediately sounded and felt right. He\u2019s got one those voices that has a really lovely balance of power and vulnerability. And because he\u2019s one of our original singers, it\u2019s like he owns the song. It\u2019s great to have back in the family.\u201d\n\nBedford\u2019s involvement speaks to another dynamic at work on Common Ground. As they approach their 18-years-young birthday, Above & Beyond are refreshing their roots to reach new heights.\n\nAs Paavo says, \u201cworking with Richard for the first time in ages has that feeling of us looking back at our beginnings \u2013 and Northern Soul definitely covers again that happy-sad territory. It sounds like something really old and something really new mixed together.\u201d\n\nOn Northern Soul, at least, the threesome are coming full circle. But as for the rest of Common Ground? On previous form, it\u2019ll showcase Above & Beyond not so much circling as spiralling upwards, outwards and onwards \u2013 not least on the not-quite-completed Is It Love (1001) a track which features another brand new vocalist. \n\n\u201cYeah, Jono sings that,\u201d chuckles Tony, \u201cwhich is something he\u2019s never done before. He\u2019s very, very critical of his own singing, but in terms of the music he likes to emulate, that Eighties pop thing, his voice is absolutely perfect on this.\u201d\n\n\"I didn\u2019t originally want to sing it, but the guys seemed to like it,\u201d begins Jono by way of (humble) explanation. The backstory, he continues, is that the song was always meant to be a vocal track. \u201cBut the lovely folk at the offices at Anjunabeats rushed it to release, so it first came out as an instrumental. Musically, it\u2019s a mix of synth pop with a strange combo of trance and almost a French disco feel to the crunchy claps in the chorus. I\u2019d put some scratch vocal melody ideas down a long time ago, and then later we came back to it with Tony writing the lyrics to fit the melodies around my original 'it\u2019s the same way down' demo lyric. I am a big Eighties synth pop fan,\u201d he acknowledges, \"so I wanted to do something with that kind of aesthetic.\" \n\nIn its own small way, Is It Love (1001) and its deft, smartly realised vocal left-turn sums up again that A&B way. As Paavo cheerfully puts it in conclusion, \u201cwe do get bored quite quickly. When we\u2019re busy and creative, we\u2019re excited. And we want to remain excited, and that means moving sideways, moving forwards\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd it means moving towards Common Ground.\n\nhttp://www.aboveandbeyond.nu\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aboveandbeyond\nhttps://twitter.com/aboveandbeyond\nhttps://www.facebook.com/aboveandbeyond\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/aboveandbeyondtv\n\nFor more information on ABOVE & BEYOND, contact: contact@anjunabeats.com",

Their in-depth knowledge in sound engineering enables them to release year after year clean, yet refreshing productions and each new track marks a subtle evolution in sound. \n\nIn the past decade, the duo has released 45 tracks and 10 remixes in total and their tracks have been remixed by artists like Albert van Abbe, Area Forty-One, Ben Buitendijk, Ben Sims, Dasha Rush, Delta Funktionen, Deepbass & Ness, Forward Strategy Group, Function, Haeken, Jonas Kopp, Matrixxman, Marcel Fengler, Michelangelo, Mike Parker, Mike Storm, Milton Bradley, Norman Nodge, Lewis Fautzi, Tensal, Pacou, Peter van Hoesen, Perc, Psyk, Re:Axis, SHDW & Obscure Shape, Shifted, Stefan Vincent, Oscar Mulero (Trolley Route) and VRIL.\nWhile Paul is the label-boss of the Dynamic Reflection imprint, its (digital only) sub-label, The Nursery (former Digital Reflection) which aims to bring focus on talented, upcoming producers, is mainly Dave's responsibility. \nAs a dj duo, their sets are energetic with a consciously built story line and evolving flow. Abstract Division likes to surprise, but never loses the interaction with the crowd. Since 2016, the duo is organising their own DECODE event series in different venues around Rotterdam. \n\n\nEARLY CAREER\n\nBefore they started their long-standing collaboration, both Dave and Paul have performed and produced together with numerous other Dutch artists. Paul's first musical collaboration was together with Marco Rane under the alias Dynamo. Together they have released on labels like Aftertaste Recordings, Planet Rhythm Records and the sub-label of Bas Mooy's and Jeroen Liebregts' Audio Assault Recordings, called ARMS.Dave got known in the scene for his label, Audiosculpture (which he founded together with Damian Keane, Eddy Kreischer and Sicco Bosscher), for its electro sub-label, called Visitors Records and for his longstanding career of vinyl-only sets as part of the duo of Miller & Keane. Under the same alias, together with Damian Keane, he got to release on Radio Matrix - the label of the Dutch-born, Berlin-based electro artist, Delta Funktionen. The three of them also produce as a trio named the 'Phantom Regiment'.\n\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS\n\nPaul and Dave met in 2009 in a club called Poema in Utrecht, where Paul worked as a booker at the time. He booked Dave as a solo performance for a Detroit special where he closed the night after Robert Hood.\nThe very first time they sat together in the studio, they've experienced such a productive flow that the first track they've ever made, took them only 3 hours to finish. In the beginning, Paul and Dave ran under the alias Miller & Boex, but after deciding on starting a collaboration together also as a dj duo, they opted for a name change. Ultimately, they have chosen for the name Abstract Division. The phrase 'abstract' was important, because both Ren\u00e9 and Paul have always perceived techno abstract and 'division' as although their is a generational gap between the two of them, their co-productions show a high level of congruity. Their first debut under their new alias was at the Dutch Soenda festival in 2013.\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL BREAKTHROUGH\n\nWhile grasping every opportunity to play at clubs and festivals all over the Netherlands, they've simultaneously started working on two separate trilogies, titled Form and Function and Time and Perception. Both trilogies received a lot of support in the Berlin underground scene around the time. One of their tracks, titled 'Compound Statement' was even used as a soundtrack, after being discovered by the producers of the Netflix series 'Sense 8'. This success was followed by numerous remixes and releases on international labels like Semantica, Enemy Records, Raw Waxes or Lanthan Audio.\nAfter the trilogies, the duo started working on a new concept of a double EP they named Contemporary Spaces which was released in 2016 on Dynamic Reflection, along with 2 more EPs dedicated for remixes done by other musicians, like Matrixxman, Lewis Fautzi, Perc, Stefan Vincent, Tensal etc.\nThe year 2017 brought an even wider support in the scene for their productions, when the founding father of the techno collective Underground Resistance, Jeff Mills opened the Rotterdamse Rave with their track Convergent. The same year, Richie Hawtin named in a BBC One Radio interview their track, Out of Alignment (released on Figure Jams, the sub-label of FIGURE) amongst his 10 favourite tracks of 2017.\n2018 was another important year for Paul and Dave as the duo celebrated the 10-year anniversary of their label with a unique concept - a special box set of 5 EPs with the contribution of artists like Blawan, Donato Dozzy, Jeroen Search, Shl\u00f8mo, Steffi etc., titled 'Continuum'. In the beginning of 2019, Dave celebrated his 50th birthday by hosting a new edition of DECODE in the duo's beloved club, Cultuurpodium Perron in Rotterdam which was re-opened again.\n\n\nUntil today, Paul and Dave live in two different cities. Therefore, to be able to produce during the weekdays as well, they have their personal computers connected in Ableton. Before upcoming events, they prepare their track lists separately from each other and they usually don't agree upfront, which direction a set should go, but they intuitively adjust it according to how their crowd responds. That is why each of their sets is more like a spontaneous b2b, but between two experienced, like-minded dj's.\nEP's, double EP's, Trilogies\n\nForm and Function EP Pt. 1 (DREF010), Dynamic Reflection, 2011\nForm and Function EP Pt. 2 (DREF009), Dynamic Reflection, 2011\nRelevance EP (LABD147), Labrynth, 2012\nForm and Function EP Pt. 3 (DREF011), Dynamic Reflection, 2012\nTime and Perception EP Pt. 1 (DREF016), Dynamic Reflection, 2013\nTime and Perception EP Pt. 2 (DREF017), Dynamic Reflection, 2013\nTime and Perception EP Pt. 3 (DREF018), Dynamic Reflection, 2013\nMetropolis EP (DREF025), Dynamic Reflection, 2015\nContemporary Spaces double EP (DREF028), Dynamic Reflection, 2016\nContemporary Spaces - The Remixes Pt. 1 (DREF031), Dynamic Reflection, 2016\nContemporary Spaces - The Remixes Pt. 2 (DREF032), Dynamic Reflection, 2016\nCorrosive Mind EP (Lanthan.audio 006 / LNTHN006), Lanthan Audio, 2016\nActivated EP (DREF035), Dynamic Reflection, 2017\nDivergent EP (SPR007), Spectral Rebel, 2017\nAftermath EP (JUST THIS /024), Just This, 2018\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\n2011 - Floating Point, Form and Function Pt. 2  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2011 - Fluctuations, Form and Function Pt.1  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2011 - Magnetic Field, Form and Function Pt. 2  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2011 - Shifted Reality, Form and Function Pt.1  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2012 - Deformation, Form and Function Pt. 3  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2012 - Relevance, Relevance EP  (Labrynth)\n2013 - Collision, Time And Perception Pt. 1  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Compound Statement, Time And Perception Pt. 2  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Comprehend, Time And Perception Pt. 1  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Fierce Tension, Time And Perception Pt. 1 (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Magnitude, Time And Perception Pt. 2  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Modal Realism, Time And Perception Pt. 3  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Solitude, Time And Perception Pt. 3  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2013 - Transmutation, Time And Perception Pt. 2  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2015 - Inducement, Various - Profile EP  (Planet Rhythm Records)\n2015 - Metropolis, Metropolis EP  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Compulsive Disorder, Contemporary Spaces   (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Concealment, Nonnative 08  (Semantica)\n2016 - Emotives, Various - Where The Night Takes Us (Enemy Records)\n2016 - Encounter, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Fade Away, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Future Existence, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Glide, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Immersion, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Incentive Structures, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Intervention, Corrosive Mind EP  (Lanthan Audio)\n2016 - Passenger, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - Prime Radiant, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2016 - The Hunt, Contemporary Spaces  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Activated, Activated EP  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Convergent, Divergent EP  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Crossing Borders, Figure Jams 002  (Figure Jams)\n2017 - Divergent, Divergent EP  (Spectral Rebel)\n2017 - Interference, Activated EP (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Into the Dawn, Activated EP  (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Out of Alignment, Figure Jams 002 EP  (Figure Jams)\n2017 - Twilight Escape, Various \u2013 3 Years Of Faut Section (Faut Section)\n2017 - Unfolding Process, Various - From Sound To Silence (Obscura)\n2018 - Aftermath, Aftermath EP (Just This)\n2018 - Blue Void, Trilogia Del Aquelarre Pt. 1 (Materia Obscura)\n2018 - Disconnected, Broken Promises EP  (Just This)\n2018 - Dissonance, Continuum 3 - Fluctus EP (Dynamic Reflection)\n2018 - Enforcement, Various - Code One (Black Codes Experiment)\n2018 - Isolated, Aftermath EP (Just This)\n2018 - Transcendent, Various - Eternal 1 EP (Attic Music)\n\nREMIXES:\n\n2011 - Phase Linear - Patrick Walker, Controle Node EP (Dynamic Reflection)\n2012 - Sub Space - Binny, Subspace EP (Orbis Records)\n2012 - Wogen - Woo York, Bualva EP  (Digital Reflection)\n2013 - Cavity Creeps - Myles Serg\u00e9, Cavity Creeps EP (Re(form))\n2014 - Sleepwalker - Deepbass, Sleepwalker EP (Rising Label)\n2015 - Shuttle - The Noisemaker, Travelers EP (Raw Waxes)\n2016 - Onwards - Keith Carnal, Onwards EP (Affin LTD)\n2016 - Alpha Magnitude - Vertical Spectrum, Magnitude EP (Dynamic Reflection)\n2017 - Luca Agnelli - Metamorphosis, Metamorphosis EP (Etruria Beat)\n2017 - Re:Axis - Coming in Peace, Ten Album Remixes (Monocline Records)\n2018 - Bubbli - Patrick Siech,Tetrahedron Cluster EP (Mary Go Wild Black)",

The introduction of affordable samplers in that period led him towards the production of his first electronic tracks.\nHis initial forays under the name Console were released in 1995, and with the help of an Atari computer, a four-track tape machine, a sampler and a small synthesizer, he made his first album Pan or ama in 1996. Around this same time he joined the band The Notwist, tasked with handling the electronic spectrum of their music, and has been a constant member since until 2015. His Console project also became a band, when Gretschmann realized that playing live with friends was much more fun. After releasing several records and remixes, doing radio shows (together with Andreas Ammer), and touring extensively, Martin decided to begin a new solo project once again.\n \nWith the rise of the new Millenium, the moniker Acid Pauli was chosen and what has started as a computer based live-act, has since morphed into a dancefloor-focused hybrid live/DJ performance, yet reserves the freedom to experiment and allows for a precise blend of eclectic selections. These unique abilities were showcased on a highly-acclaimed installment of Crosstown Rebels' Get Lost mix series, a lovely journey that encapsulated the range of emotion and depth present in his performances, and on 'Countdown to Zero', a DJ mix with Damian Lazarus.\nAcid Pauli\u2019s most recent full-length album, Mst, was released on Clown & Sunset in the summer of 2012. It was the subject of both wide-ranging praise and comparisons with Mr Scruff, Lemon Jelly, Ricardo Villalobos and Bjo\u0308rk. 2014 saw Acid Pauli release three collaborative records and, amongst an intense worldwide tour schedule and album with The Notwist, play a number of high-profile solo dates. These included the Day Zero festival and a sound exhibition in Japan.\nIn 2016, as well as releasing several remixes and his popular track \u2018Nana\u2019, Martin started a record label called Oui\u0308e together with Nico Stojan and handled the first release themselves. Martin also took part in a unique and ambitious project called The Golden Machine, creating an electronic device that produced a continuous stream of music for an entire year, and wrote the music for a feature film - \"Es war einmal Indianerland\" - a Coming of Age story based on the novel by Nils Mohl. In the Spring of 2017, Martin will release his second Acid Pauli album, BLD.\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Acid+Pauli",

He was DJing every weekend as part of the Every1Sound system, a strictly techno and acid techno system, playing music from the likes of the Stay Up Forever Collective. The crew organised parties across the capital in abandoned warehouses, empty abbatoirs, sex toy storage places, fields, and loads of other reclaimed spaces he'd rather not share on a public website. \n\nHe then launched his own promotion 'Vote Techno Party' in a dark and secret (ish) Brixton arch in 2008. This was a proper crash course in all things party-related, from losing loads of money on the door, acting as 'security' even though he was a skinny 10 stone, then rushing up to the decks to play acid techno. While lots of fun it wasn't financially sustainable, but luckily Aaron Liberator invited him to be a resident DJ at Stay Up Forever's legendary acid techno night 'Nuclear Free Zone' at the equally legendary Club 414. This evolved into a new event at the club: 'Smash Techno', where Steve was resident alongside Aaron Liberator, Birinight and DJ Roo.\n\nAround this time Steve was lucky enough to be invited by DDR into his studio, to learn close-up from the legendary acid producer. Steve then launched his vinyl label Avinit Records which features his own productions alongside a mixture of established acid techno legends and leaders of the new wave of acid techno. In 2019 he launched 'Pounding Warehouse Recordings', a digital label showcasing banging techno from the non-acid side of things but at a similar bpm to acid techno for mixing things up. \n\nHe plays at clubs, festivals, raves in the UK and internationally (Barcelona, Colombia, Czech Republic, Poland, Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Wales so far and open to more for any promoters reading). He also promotes occasional events including Not A Public Nuisance, often in collaboration with underground London soundsystems which he still plays on whenever possible.\n\nHis sets are never pre-planned and depend on the vibe, crowd and DJs before and after, but as a rough guide: usually a mixture of upfront acid techno with oldskool 303 sounds, sometimes a classic acid techno banger or two, a couple of his unreleased tracks, plus some non-acid pounders to build the set and atmosphere.\nAvinit 001 - Acid Steve & DDR - Raves Like This / Winning!\nAvinit 002 - Acid Steve - Late At Night\nAvinit 003 - Acid Steve - Cult of Acid\nAvinit 004 - Acid Steve & Steve Mills - Acid Anarchy\nAvinit 005 - Acid Steve- Hello Officer\nAvinit 006 - Acid Steve - Mad As Hell\nAvinit 007 - Acid Steve - An Abandoned Warehouse\nPounding Warehouse 001a - Acid Steve - Crazy Lights \nPounding Warehouse 001b - Acid Steve - Crazy Sounds\nPounding Warehouse 002a - Acid Steve - Let us all unite\nPounding Warehouse 002b - Acid Steve - Drug dens sex parlours death traps\nPounding Warehouse 003a - Acid Steve - Crimes of government\nPounding Warehouse 003b - Acid Steve - Pissed Off\nGetafix17 - Underground techno music",

Brick-by-brick, the sound became a signature felt across club land, but a connection remains between the sound of Adam\u2019s earliest work and the sought after productions he now brandishes. \n \nAt the helm of Adam Beyer\u2019s career stands a brand that has taken techno to truly global heights. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2016, Drumcode\u2019s full-hearted philosophy of releasing music always with the DJ in mind has allowed the label to expand into an all-encompassing brand, one now heralded as much as a musical identity as it is an attitude among the underground community. Providing a rare opportunity for Beyer to simultaneously renew what is current whilst looking to the next generation of talents, it\u2019s expansion into branded nights across the globe has made this one of the best travelled brands in modern techno, with its branded radio show taking further flight with broadcasts across more than 53 different countries. Its sound has been imitated, it\u2019s durability tested by the changing tides of the music industry, but Drumcode\u2019s ongoing peak is a testament to a brand that has dared to take the long way around in the name of becoming a sustainable and consistent musical powerhouse.  \n\nBehind the decks, there are many different forces to be experienced from Beyer. Be it an international festival headline spot or a more intimate club show, his solo sets adapt and evolve to fit the various moods of his globetrotting tour schedule. Alongside partner Ida Engberg, looser afterhours sets with the ability to focus on songs have become a favourite across the international club circuit. Paired alongside his ability to take the stage with numerous members of the global techno community, Adam Beyer\u2019s live persona truly knows no limits. \n\nOpting for business as usual over tired celebratory gimmicks, Beyer approaches 2016 in fighting form. Kick-starting a brand new venture in the form of Junction 2 Festival, a suitably stacked out summer of international festival and Ibiza dates add to a marker year for Beyer. Whether it\u2019s on record, behind the decks or under the reliable Drumcode umbrella, Adam Beyer continues to unravel an unprecedented success story for the global underground circuit.",

    "/dj/adamport": "BIOGRAPHY ENGLISH:\nTechno\u2019s biggest flaw is its self-referencial tendency. You know the deal, the common contemporary DJ/Producer steals an Underground Resistance-Record from his older brother at the age of 16 (biographical details may vary, not to impair the facts, though), thus presuming to have found the holy grail (what, of course, nobody is claiming to deny). His world is shrinking down to Detroit, Chicago, New York and Berlin within the following years, he\u2019ll equip himself with records and turntables and not look over the rim of his MKII ever again.\n\nAdam Ports biography is different. Adam was Hardcore, when he was 16. No, not Rotterdam-Hardcore. We\u2019re talking New York-, Boston- and Washington D.C.-Hardcore here. It\u2019s a past that he still lives up to, cultivating it in his vegetarian-straight-edge-lifestyle. After that there was HipHop. He got in touch with turntablism, discovered his love for vinyl and evolved to be a skilled DJ for the first time. Then, finally came Techno.\n\nThis way of tracing down spaces, giving one the best possible chance of self-development, is the essential reason for Ports presence being so unique. There\u2019s no scene-dictated tunnel view in his activities, there is only a pointed emphasis on style, on groove and sophistication. An emphasis, that, because it\u2019s informed by Dub, Danchall, Rap, Soul or even Psychedelic Rock, is advanced enough to always shine through the inflationary characteristic of the genre as notably original. That applies to both, his productions and his DJ-sets. What Adam Port is laying his hands on might have its place within the parameters of House and Techno, but it\u2019s always more than that. It\u2019s his style. \n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nBIOGRAPHIE DEUTSCH:\nTechnos gr\u00f6\u00dfte Schw\u00e4che ist dessen Selbstreferenzialit\u00e4t. Der gemeine zeitgen\u00f6ssische DJ und Produzent klaut im Alter von 16 eine Underground Resistance-Platte aus der Sammlung seines gro\u00dfen Bruders (minimale biographische Abweichungen sind durchaus m\u00f6glich, \u00e4ndern jedoch nichts am Tatbestand), meinen damit den heiligen Gral gefunden zu haben (was nat\u00fcrlich grunds\u00e4tzlich niemand abstreiten m\u00f6chte), lassen in den folgenden Jahren die Welt auf Detroit, Chicago, New York und Berlin zusammen schrumpfen, r\u00fcsten sich nach und nach mit Equipment und Platten aus und blicken nie wieder \u00fcber den Plattentellerrand hinaus.\n\nAdam Ports Biographie ist anders. Adam war mit 16 Hardcore. (Nein, nicht Rotterdam-Hardcore, sondern New York-, Boston- und Washington D.C.-Hardcore), eine Vergangenheit, die er auch heute noch feiert und die er in seinem vegetarian-straight-edge-lifestyle pflegt und kultiviert. Danach kam das HipHop-Kapitel und die Ann\u00e4herung an Turntablism, die ersten eigenen Plattenspieler, die Liebe zum Vinyl. Dann erst und genau zur richtigen Zeit kam Techno.\n\nDieses Aufsp\u00fcren der R\u00e4ume, die den bestm\u00f6glichen Platz zur Selbstentfaltung bieten, macht die Pr\u00e4senz Ports so einzigartig. Bei ihm gibt es keinen Szene-diktierten Tunnelblick, bei ihm gibt es immer nur die Pointierung von Style, von Groove und von Raffinesse, die gerade wegen ihrer Schulung an Dub, Danchall, Rap, Soul oder Psychedelic Rock advanced genug ist, um aus der Techhouse-Inflation als besonders originell hervorzustechen. Das gilt sowohl f\u00fcr seine Produktionen als auch f\u00fcr seine DJ-Sets. Was Adam Port heute anfasst, bewegt sich zwar konsequent inmitten der Parameter House und Techno, ist aber trotzdem mehr als das. Es ist sein Stil.",

Famous for playing \u2018old-school\u2019 house and garage, the residency encouraged Adam to search for old records as well as new, an ethos still embraced today.",

WARPED has since evolved into very select events and a monthly Ibiza Global Radio Show \u2018Warped After Hours\u2019 which hosts rising stars from the Middle East and India alongside Adam's peerless selections.\n\nMore success followed via his work at Ohm Records, the legendary record store and agency he co-ran, as they brought names like Sven Vath to the region for their debut. Often he'd be the warm-up on those nights as well, showcasing his range of sounds spanning deep, chugging vibes, pulsating and engaging techno and all-embracing electronica alongside Derrick May, Carl Craig and Marco Carola. From there, he became an essential part of the award-winning Groove on the Grass festival team, yet again finding himself at the forefront of the forward-thinking dance music scene in the Middle East, pushing techno and electronica to a growing audience.\n\nThat progress regionally has translated into international gigs, including sets in Europe and Asia and becoming a headline name in his own right in his native India. Production-duties soon followed for the certified sound engineer, with releases on labels in UK, Holland and on his beloved KitchenSync Records which he runs alongside two other friends in Dubai. And his sets have been picked up by outlets across the world, with his Wild City mix for Resident Advisor the first to be featured from India.\n\nNow represented by  Bleep  in India and  DCS4  for his European DJ bookings, and with a new A \\ S \\ O \\ M alias and album released covering downtempo, leftfield and alternative electronica, Adam continues to grow and evolve and thrive just like his first love, techno.\nYou Don't Know - BSR \nThought Frame - Techfui\nItZsumo - Since 16\nAcid Run - KitchenSync Records\nBrain Freeze - KitchenSync Records\nCombined Studies by A \\ S \\ O \\ M - KitchenSync Records\nMadras (Remix) - KitchenSync Records\nForgetive (Remix) - KitchenSync Records\nOne Night In Garcia (Single) - Unknown Territory\nStranded in BCN - KitchenSync Records\nWhite Space (Various Artists) A \\ S \\ O \\ M - KitchenSync Records\nWhat's on for Breakfast?? - Sept 22nd 2020 on Bandcamp",

    "/dj/adamx": "Adam X\u2019s illustrious music career first came about in 1990 in Brooklyn, NYC where he was born and raised. His earliest productions were released during this period and he soon gained momentum as one of the most adept DJ\u2019s on the global underground techno scene.\n \nAlongside pioneer and brother Frankie Bones he also opened the doors of Groove\nRecords in Brooklyn as America\u2019s first true outlet for underground electronic music with a direct focus on the techno genre. The Groove Records team would also take part in organizing the first techno events to ever take place in NYC, including the legendary Storm Rave that started in 1991. Storm Rave was the first all-techno warehouse parties organized on the East Coast of America and the line-ups included many up-and-coming artists who would go on to become global techno cult figures.\n\nThe Sonic Groove label was born in 1995 at the upgraded Manhattan location of the\nshop ( also having changed name from Groove Records to Sonic Groove during the\ntransition ). Adam continues to operate the label in an exemplary and innovative way\nwith over 100 releases to date. Primarily a vinyl focused label and including digital\ndistribution, the discography\u2019s current core roster is a mix of EBM and Industrial legends Monolith, Orphx, Rhys Fulber, and Fixmer / McCarthy as well as modern day techno heavyweights Dasha Rush,  The Panacea, Blush Response and Max Durante.\n\nA unique perspective and acute knowledge of the music can be recognized in his DJ\nand live sets which have always retained a unique sense of an un-compromised\napproach to the dance floor, keeping with the sanctity of breaking new boundaries in sound and evolving with an edge of genre defiance and auditory cross-pollination. Adam\u2019s approach facilitated acid techno\u2019s dominance in the early to mid nineties and he nearly single handedly put the Industrial and EBM Techno cross-over genres on the contemporary map. \n\nHis Traversable Wormhole, ADMX-71, The Secret Initiative, Mass-X-Odus and X-Crashed side-projects along with his collaboration with co-conspirator U.K. based artist Perc with their project AX&P, have all strongly impacted the most discerning audiences. \n\nAdam X has also released his own work on his seminal imprint as well as releases on some of the most essential labels to exist both past and present such as, Wax Trax!, Direct Drive, Magnetic North, Peacefrog, Drop Bass Network, CLR, Hands Productions as well as preeminent contemporary labels Aufnahme + Wiedergabe, L.I.E.S and Hospital Productions.\n\nAdam currently resides in the electronic music capital of the world Berlin, Germany.

    "/dj/adanatwins": "Driven by a deep-seated desire to transmit emotion through electronic music, the German duo have been working together since 2006, merging Benjamin's love of hip-hop and Friso's passion for club music to produce a series of highly-regarded releases that form the foundation of their global success. Their early triumphs led to bookings all over the world, delivering their unique musical vision to dance floors on every continent, with support from a wide range of dance music luminaries including Radio 1 legend Pete Tong, Solomun, Tale Of Us and many more. Now firmly established within the underground electronic music scene, the Adana Twins are universally respected as label owners, A&Rs, producers, and inspiring DJs who love to play long marathon-sets.\n\nThe Adana Twins have a penchant for deep, dark, emotionally-charged music, which has fueled the evolution of their sound, from the house-inspired productions that thrust them into the limelight, into a more nuanced, techno-influenced vibe. Both men grew up surrounded by electronic music in their hometown Hamburg, where the sound was so prevalent, it is part of their musical DNA and, as they have matured as artists, so too has their sound.\n\nAs they\u2019ve grown in stature and influence the Adana Twins have channelled their love for electronic music into their own platform, TAU. The label was launched in 2018 with the aim of giving them the creative space to expand their sound while also discovering and nurturing new artists. Across the first few releases the duo have signed and released music from a variety of lesser-known talents, establishing a strong identity from the very beginning. Artists like Innellea, Human Machine, Mathias Schober, BOg, Santiago Garcia, Daniel Bortz, Luis Junior, Isole\u0301e, Amberoom, and Ede have appeared on the label, which has had a phenomenal response from fans and DJs alike. It\u2019s a project that has filled both men with inspiration and a renewed hunger for music in all its aspects; digging, discovering, producing and playing.\n\nTheir own debut on the label came with TAU003. Entitled \u2018Risen\u2019, the EP reflects the duo\u2019s innate ability to create haunting melodies and goosebump-inducing moments of sheer exhilaration. Blending mysterious atmospherics, heartrending melancholy and contagious rhythms, the release cemented the Adana Twins reputation as purveyors of quality melodic techno of the highest order. After \u2018Risen\u2019 they followed up with another killer cut on TAU\u2019s first compilation, Spektrum 1. \u2018Jumanji\u2019, a new wave-inspired production with an unforgettable melody and a highly-infectious groove, hit No.1 in Beatport\u2019s Indie Dance chart and remains a favourite on the dancefloor months after it was released.\n\nIn recent years the guys have formed a close bond with Berlin\u2019s iconic Watergate stable, joining the family in 2017 and utilising the new relationship to push forward with their techno-fueled ambitions. It all started with \u2018Etah\u2019 which dropped in February 2017 on the Watergate Affairs 02 compilation. Since then they have served up the Flower Of Cane EP and its follow-up Jupiter, plus \u2018Zuul\u2019 which appeared on Watergate\u2019s epic compilation celebrating its 15-year anniversary. In late 2018 the duo were invited to host an installment of the brand\u2019s highly-respected mix series. In typical Adana Twins style, they set out to make their mark, going above and beyond to collect material from their wide circle of talented friends to produce a first for the series - a mix comprised 100% exclusive, unreleased tracks by the likes of Acid Pauli, Musumeci, Upercent, SBTH, Daniel Bortz and many more. They also produced a monster remix of Patrice Ba\u0308umel's 10-year-old track \u2018Roar\u2019 especially for the Watergate mix. The deadly rework shot to No.1 in the Beatport charts and has remained in the chart since November 2018. No surprise as it was roadtested by Tale Of Us and Sven Va\u0308th all over the world with an amazing reaction everywhere it was played. In late 2019, a vinyl-only release on the label will hit the shelves including two Adana Twins remixes of Josh Wink\u2019s classic \u2018Higher State Of Consciousness\u2019.\n\nOutside Watergate, they have also released with Solomun\u2019s Diynamic label. Their track \u2018Uncompromising\u2019 was part of a compilation on the influential label in 2017 and it went down a storm, crushing clubs and festivals around the world. In 2019 Benjamin and Friso were invited to contribute to Diynamic\u2019s infamous \u2018Picture\u2019 series. Artists are encouraged to showcase their output with a body of work created exclusively for the series. Somewhere between an EP and an album, the \u2018Picture\u2019 release has allowed the Adana Twins to really stretch out and demonstrate their production prowess with the lead track \u2018My Computer\u2019 (featuring vocals by Glowal) already going down an absolute storm... So much so that some DJs have even ripped the tune from a YouTube video so they could play it!\n\nParallel to their production and label curation endeavours, the boys have continued to traverse the globe, turning in performances on the big stage at festivals such as Fusion and Melt! in their native Germany to Loveland in Amsterdam, Beyond The Valley and Pitch Festival in Australia, together with an exhaustive list of the world\u2019s greatest clubs including DC-10 (Ibiza), fabric (London), Robert Johnson (Frankfurt), Badaboum (Paris), Vision (Tokyo), Revolver (Melbourne), Module (Istanbul), The Block (Tel Aviv), Warung Club (Brazil), Stereo Bar (Montreal), Corsica Studios (London), Halcyon (San Francisco), Output (New York), PAL and Golden Pudel (Hamburg) and, of course, the family home Watergate in Berlin, plus many many more. They are regulars in Ibiza throughout the summer season, with gigs at Solomun\u2019s seminal +1 party, Heart, and other clubs.\n\nThe Adana Twins continue to flourish, staying inspired and maintaining a high level of quality across their music, label and performances. They send dance floors into uproar wherever they go, transmitting pure emotion while nurturing new talent and courting the attention of the scene\u2019s biggest DJs, clubs and festivals. It\u2019s a dream come true for the Hamburg duo as they continue to push themselves, and their scene, forward every step of the way...\nReleases:\n\nPicture: Adana Twins (Diynamic)\nJumanji (Various Artists \u2013 Spektrum 1) (TAU)\nRisen EP (TAU)\nWatergate 25 EP #2 (Watergate)\nRoar Remix / Aufstand der Massen (Watergate)\nWatergate 25  (Watergate)\nJupiter EP  (Watergate)\nRelentless (Watergate / 2017)\nUncompromising (Diynamic / 2017)\nEtah (Watergate / 2017)\nPerspective (Exploited / 2016)\nHeroe Remixes (Exploited / 2015)\nHeroe (Exploited / 2015)\nBleeding ft.

As he discovered new genres of fine house music, he started promoting that sound locally. In due time, he began traveling frequently on gigs. As his passion for house music morphed into something bigger, he and his friends supported the scene by experiencing live sets by world-class DJs in different clubs all over Europe. In 1999 he decided to start mixing his own style of dance music, which could be described as a deep, hypnotic and mesmerizing progressive house. But that is not all. During his sets, he paints the room with the sound of techy flavours, hence concocting a roller coaster ride through all the genres with his music. With his own record labels at his disposal ( Only Records and SNEJL - the first ever Romanian label focusing on releasing the best underground house music),  he allowed many new talents to display their artistic expressions through them a label which got enormous support and feedback from the biggest names in the industry including John Digweed, Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo, Laurent Garnier, Satoshi Tomiie, Sander Kleinenberg, Nick Warren, Desyn Masiello, Pete Tong,  and includes artists under roster like : Ozgur Can, Deep Mariano, Ludovic Vendi, Dinamoe,  Dilo, Rouzbeh Delavari, Subksy, Christian Cambas, Livio & Roby,, Kaan Duzarat, Introvert, 3 Colours, Baunder, Claes Rosen, CPM, Komytea ,etc.\nIn 2004 he\u2019s the first Romanian Dj who got invited at the famous Oslo Nights show where he impressed a lot with his flowing mix, which was broadcasted in every corner of the world through www.di.fm .After that he finds himself promoting, organizing and playing at parties all over the world with big names such as : Christian Cambas, Jonathan Lisle, Kosmas Epsilon, Kazell, G-Pal & Anna Maria X, Andy Newland, Ozgur Can, Deep Mariano and the list goes on.

Orbiting around her own output, Danza Tribale is intended to provide a bespoke landing platform for techno dynamics both obscure and profound, alternately wild and held-in, instinctive and sophisticated, functional yet far from merely tool-esque.\n\nFresh off the release of her latest EP, 'Ritmo', Adiel strikes again with 'Tokyo' followed by 'Cavallina' EP where she teamed up with none other than Italian dub techno legend Donato Dozzy to sculpt a truly mind-bending mosaic of delayed drums, stealth acid accents and rolling bass moves. In July 2019 she returned with \u2018Musicofilia\u2019, her first record outside her own label, on Kangding Ray\u2019s ara imprint. Adiel this time delivered tracks which will suit a variety of spatio-temporal dynamics, while still crafted for the club. \nIn February 2020, on her Danza Tribale imprint, she had a new exciting EP in collaboration with one of the most respected figures in the techno scene, Northern Electronics label head Anthony Linell. \n\nLater on World Wide Window, collaboration between Enisslab, Sebastian Mullaert's Circle Of Live project and visual art collective Sbagliato, featuring more than six hours of unreleased music by 56 artists including Adiel.\n\nJust landed a few weeks ago, the four tracks release debut on Stroboscopic Artefacts \"If Not Now When?\".\n\nNow in the works, Club Quarantaene release: 8 tracks from artists at the first event that sum up the sound of virtual raving in 2020 and a new exciting project coming out on Danza Tribale.\n\nAdiel\u2019s skills both as a DJ and producer have seen her play at some of the coolest clubs and festivals around Europe, such as Dekmantel, Off Sonar in Barcelona where she did her first Boiler Room, Berghain for the Klockworks showcase and Panorama Bar invited by Marcel Dettman, London\u2019s Printworks for Ben Klock\u2019s Photon event series, Concrete in Paris, DC 10 in Ibiza, De School in Amsterdam, Fuse in Brussels and other prestigious venues.

    "/dj/adilhiani": "He first found notoriety in Morocco from an early age, learning the trade as a DJ thanks to his cousin DJ Key, one of the leading lights in the country\u2019s hip hop scene. From 2003, at the tender age of 14, he was regularly touring and refining his scratching and beat-juggling skills, and within a few years he had branched out to try his hand at production. Once the internet became more widely accessible in Morocco, his natural appetite for new sounds led him to discover all kinds of music, from jazz to blues and unsurprisingly on to electronic music. Early dalliances with funky house found him plenty of gigs, but as his knowledge and taste deepened towards more experimental kinds of club music, he quickly moved beyond the interests of the crowds he was playing to. \n\nThe online connection provided the only outlet for his music for a number of years, while he refined his production skills and reached out to portals that might be interested in hosting his mixes. It was through this determined networking that Laurent Grumel, a Frenchman in Morocco, discovered Adil\u2019s sound and pitched the idea for a record label that combined contemporary electronic artists with local Moroccan musicians in a cross-cultural collaboration, and so Cosmo Records was born. Alongside Driss & Mehdi they launched the project by inviting Argenis Brito to Casablanca to record the first release in the summer of 2009, and so the label grew from there to work with Masomenos, Rene Sandoval and Philip Bader, and Pier Bucci. \n\nDue to his location, international bookings were a challenge for Adil due to visa complications, until he moved to Toulouse to study in 2011. As a result of the connections he had forged through the label work, gigs soon materialized alongside Sonja Moonear and Dandy Jack in Lausanne and Geneva, and then across Europe from France and Spain to Italy and Greece. One of the defining gigs of this phase of his career was being invited to play the infamous Club Der Visionaere in Berlin in 2013, where he ended up playing for 11 hours straight.\n\nAfter three years living in Europe he ended his studies and returned to Casablanca to focus on developing his own music production as well as the sound of Cosmo Records. The label released its most ambitious project to date in 2015, celebrating five years of operation with artists such as San Proper, Radiq, Dandy Jack and Yapacc collaborating with Moroccan players such as Khansa Batma and Saad El Bouaamri. \n\nWith his own productions sitting comfortably alongside these celebrated musicians, Adil continues to expand as an artist in his own right. Rather than lazily dropping samples of African and Eastern music into formulaic house and techno structures, he pushes his craft to deal in rhythmic arrangements influenced as much by the Far East as the music of his own country, seeking to create a true fusion of Eastern and Western cultures grounded in an innate understanding of sounds from all over the world. In this way his sonic identity goes against the grain, driven by an unquenchable passion for meaningful musical experience even when he could have taken an easier road to success a long time ago.\n\nwords by Oli Warwick\nAdil Hiani feat.

As more and more time has passed the interest of Benn Finn for the music developed. Santa Clause had to carry large speakers to put them under the Christmas tree. When he was a little boy he and his father listened to records from Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. This is the source for his interesting music. Surely he changed his grasp of music growing up. But he didn..t know what to do and wasn..t able to throw himself at only one kind of music. At the age of 20 he started to meet his friends in clubs like the Berghain, Bar 25 and Watergate. The Berlin \u2013 Night life was a completely new world to him. The music these clubs were playing was exciting. Benn Finn wanted to know the secret of electronic music. His vinyl collection grew fast. He started to create his own sounds. The internet, books, friends and a lot of time had been used up to develop the sound of Finn Records. Many scene-insiders he had met while playing his records in the clubs of Berlin helped to find his own way of making music. His first self produced tracks were born and published at different labels. To be more independently, Benn Finn decided to create his own label, called Finn Records , founded at the end of 2009 . There he will publish music with quite an own style in the future.\nAnd Matthias Adler saw the light of day on the 26th of July 1981 and grew\nup in Oranienburg, near Berlin.\nIn the middle of the Nineties, he discovers Electronic Dance Music, especially through\nBerlin House TV. Fascinated by its diversity, he develops a growing interest in noncommercial\nelectronic music. Well, Berlin is around the corner and the choice of parties\nnigh on endless, what leads to countless excursions into the landscapes of Club Culture.\nNot before long, Matthias Adler gains his first experiences as a DJ. Deand\naccelerating turntables to create a seemingly never-ending song that shakes the\ncrowd from the hip, has a great charm for him. But that\u2019s not enough for Matthias Adler.\nFrom 2008 on, he concentrates on producing his own music. In exchange with friends,\nand a Learning-by-doing attitude, he starts to work with all the music production tools on\nthe market.\nAt the moment, Matthias Adler produces mainly Minimal Techno. But his\nphase of experimentation is not yet over and we are already waiting joyously for what is\nstill to come\u2026\nThe co-operation with Benn Finn (Adler & Finn)\nwere, and still are, extremely rewarding and let us hope for more great\nproductions and further co-operations\u2026\u201dminimal forever and feel good\u201d.",

Whether DJing as Adlib or promoting with Shameless and People of Earth (P.O.E), he is constantly sharing a radical vision of good times, heady tunes and dancefloor debauchery with every one he meets. His versatility, technical skills and mixture of cerebral yet crowd-rocking cuts earn him regular headlining spots at clubs, renegade parties and outdoor festivals across the Western US and beyond.\n\nDevin learned to DJ in 1998, somehow teaching himself on a pair of broken turntables from his small Idaho hometown\u2019s radio station. His technical mixing and unique blends of darker progressive, acid house and techno quickly earned him bookings in Boise and Salt Lake City, where he was an instrumental part of the late 90s underground. By 2000, he wasn\u2019t even old enough to drink but had already played hundreds of events across the Northwest and was expanding his sound to incorporate a wide array of forward-thinking electronic music.\n\nDevin relocated to Seattle in 2002. His reputation as a versatile DJ has only grown since then, landing him a residency with Shameless, the eclectic crew behind many of Seattle\u2019s most infamous techno and electro events. He has opened local gigs for headliners as diverse as Garth and Jeno, Brodinski, Kilowatts, Meat Katie and the Flashbulb, and in 2008 alone headlined events in Portland, Salt Lake, Black Rock City, Boise and L.A, where he is a member of the notorious Monkey Do! crew. He returns to his Idaho roots every summer to perform at and co-promote Esthetic Evolution, one of the most diverse, forward thinking and successful electronic music festivals in the Northwest.\n\nIn his everyday life, Devin strives to blur the boundaries between art, music and progressive politics, all of which he believes are the driving forces in a healthy society. He uses his opportunities as a DJ to bridge communities and build lasting connections with like-minded people. His music and skills may be what get him booked somewhere, but his belief in the power of people and parties are what bring him back. Listen to the music and join the underground, because there are 45 revolutions on the turntable\u2026 and one in the streets.\nDevin Kelly AKA Adlib - The Mothership Misconnection (Manifest Northwest - MNNW 10)",

The two men carved out a career as one of the most consistently delivering DJ/producer duos in the house and techno scene: Adriatique.\n\nThe key to an enduring partnership is, of course, to complement each other, and the two Adrians do so admirably. Music-wise, their various tastes combine into one unique sound, and their respective preference for studio work and performance means that both aspects are equally well covered. \n\nAdriatique\u2019s DJ performances as well as their productions are long, meditative, relentlessly building affairs, ever challenging the listener with subtle twists interrupting their hypnotic groove.

Called Siamese, their imprint releases Adriatique\u2019s own music as well as productions by others, as long as it adheres to the Adrians\u2019 creed: that music should be meditation. Going above and beyond the average for a label, Siamese also supports visual and performance artists, organizing club nights that place these collaborators in the spotlights just as much as the musical stars. \n\nDrawing from their own experience as strangers turned fulltime partners, Adrian and Adrian know that it is the bridging of differences that breeds creativity.
